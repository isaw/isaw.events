        Plone is a user friendly Content Management System running on top of Python,
        Zope and the CMF.
        
        It benefits from all features of Zope/CMF such as: RDBMS integration,
        Python/Perl extensions, Object Oriented Database, Web configurable workflow,
        pluggable membership and authentication, Undos, Form validation, amongst many
        many other features. Available protocols: FTP, XMLRPC, HTTP and WEBDAV
        Turn it into a distributed application system by installing ZEO.
        
        Plone shares some of the qualities of Livelink, Interwoven and Documentum. It
        aims to be *the* open source out-of-the-box publishing system.
        
        What is Plone?
        --------------
        
        Plone is a ready-to-run content management system that is built on the powerful
        and free Zope application server. Plone is easy to set up, extremely flexible,
        and provides you with a system for managing web content that is ideal for
        project groups, communities, web sites, extranets and intranets.
        
        - *Plone is easy to install.* You can install Plone with a a click and run
        installer, and have a content management system running on your computer in
        just a few minutes.

        made Plone easy and attractive for content managers to add, update, and
        mantain content.
        
        - *Plone is international.* The Plone interface has more than 35 translations,
        and tools exist for managing multilingual content.
        
        - *Plone is standard.* Plone carefully follows standards for usability and
        accessibility. Plone pages are compliant with US Section 508, and the W3C's
        AAA rating for accessibility.
        
        - *Plone is Open Source.* Plone is licensed under the GNU General Public
        License, the same license used by Linux. This gives you the right to use
        Plone without a license fee, and to improve upon the product.
        
        - *Plone is supported.* There are close to a hundred developers in the Plone
        Development Team around the world, and a multitude of companies that
        specialize in Plone development and support.
        
        - *Plone is extensible.* There is a multitude of add-on products for Plone to
        add new features and content types. In addition, Plone can be scripted using
        web standard solutions and Open Source languages.
        
        - *Plone is technology neutral.* Plone can interoperate with most relational
        database systems, open source and commercial, and runs on a vast array of
        platforms, including Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris and BSD.
        
        Technical overview
        ------------------
        
        Plone is a content management framework that works hand-in-hand and sits on top
        of Zope, a widely-used Open Source web application server and development
        system. To use Plone, you don't need to learn anything about Zope; to develop
        new Plone content types, a small amount of Zope knowledge is helpful, and it is
        covered in the `documentation`_.
        
        Zope itself is written in Python, an easy-to-learn, widely-used and supported
        Open Source programming language. Python can be used to add new features to
        Plone, and used to understand or make changes to the way that Zope and Plone
        work.
        
        By default, Plone stores its contents in Zope's built in transactional object
        database, the ZODB. There are products and techniques, however, to share
        information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem
        files, etc.
        
        Plone runs on Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and many other platforms;
        double-click installers are available for Windows and Mac OS X, and RPM
        packages are available for Linux. For full information, see the
        `plone.org product page`_.

        [vangheem]

        3.3.2 - November 3, 2009
        ------------------------
        
        - Shift "Item type" options under the advanced search page to the right
        when viewed for RTL scripts. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9666
        [emanlove]
        
        - Make sure the folder_listing, folder_summary_view, and folder_tabular_view
        call getText with a full acquisition chain (but make the conditional for
        whether to display text test for the existence of getText on the aq_base'd
        context to avoid accidental acquisition).  This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8463
        [davisagli]
        
        - Use PlonePAS methods for adding and removing members from groups, as well
        as for listing group membership. These methods are PAS aware and thus work
        correctly with PAS plugins other than the GroupUserFolder. Thanks to
        Giovanni Toffoli for the initial patch.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9163
        [mj]

        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9111
        [naro]
        
        - Check AddPortalContent permission before calling invokeFactory from
        FactoryTool.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8748
        [naro]
        
        - Added helper methods to the i18nl10n method, to change the default date and
        time formats used by zope.i18n.locales. This makes it easier to use a 24
        hour clock in the date/time widgets for English speakers.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed msgids in portlets.xml. There is no support for
        msgids in the import of portlets.xml implementation.
        This allow to extract translatable strings with i18ndude.
        This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9631
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fixed some duplicated msgids with different defaults.

        - Make the external_editor link on OS X use the .zem extension.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7291
        [optilude]
        
        - Minor or trivial changes and fixes to many templates for obtain
        code that is also XHTML Strict
        See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/4379
        [keul]
        
        - Fixed *folder_constraintypes_form.cpt* template; was XHTML invalid when
        showing portal type with whitespaces (like "News Item")
        [keul]
        
        - Fixed handling of URL fragment identifiers in form-tabbing. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9500
        [mj]
        
        
        3.3.1 - September 9, 2009
        -------------------------
        
        - Defined the portal_url variable to
        context/@@plone_portal_state/navigation_root_url
        in author.cpt and personalize_form.cpt. Plone 4 and trunk are not impacted.

        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fix ITranslatable to use the canonical interface from LinguaPlone or fall
        back to a Zope3-style interface.
        [hannosch, witsch]
        
        - Fixed a bug which deletes an object in the acquisition path instead of
        the original object in case of a catalog inconsistency. This closes #9046.
        [pilz]
        
        
        3.3 - August 18, 2009
        ---------------------
        
        - Fix broken IE6 CSS support.
        [spliter]
        
        
        3.3rc5 - August 1, 2009
        -----------------------
        
        - Remove trailing space from
        history_compare_with_previous_inline.png.metadata filename.
        This fixes http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/9367
        [wichert].
        
        - Modified the history viewlet style so actions are green without
        background and border. Messages are on a blue background.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.3rc4 - July 7, 2009
        ---------------------
        
        - Added migration step to fix missing cooked expressions in
        portal_css, which could mess up the site UI.  Fix by Tom Gross.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9141
        [maurits]
        
        - Upgrade to jQuery 1.3.2. This fixes multiple bugs on various browsers,
        allows use of more jQuery plugins (particularly current versions of
        jQuery UI). The only BBB problem I am aware of is use of the @ in
        attribute selectors (as in a[@target=_blank]), which has been deprecated
        for a long time and is no longer supported in jQuery 1.3.
        [wichert]
        
        - Make the BBB support for registerIndexableAttribute() more robust by only
        registering the indexer adapters when ZCML is loaded. This should fix
        issues with functional tests written for older versions of Plone.
        [optilude]
        
        - Don't rely on a Zope 2 style interface in the getObjPositionInParent
        indexer - accept the proper Zope 3 interface for IOrderedContainer as well.
        [optilude]
        
        - When viewing the prefs_install_products_form, do not do inline
        migration for profiles that were previously unknown as this may hide
        valid upgrade steps in some cases.
        [maurits]
        
        
        3.3rc3 - May 22, 2009
        ---------------------
        
        - Hide the NuPlone uninstall profile from the list of available extensions
        at Plone site creation.
        [wichert]
        
        - mark_special_links.js: Fix jQuery syntax for element wrapping. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8200
        [dunlapm]
        
        - form_tabbing.js: Allow for selection of a fieldset tab other than the default
        if a url hash is in the form of #fieldset-[fieldsetname]. This allows for
        graceful fallback if JavaScript is disabled.
        [dunlapm]
        
        - Show old and new profile versions for products with profile, this closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9172
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Removed width from eventDetails CSS class, this closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8933
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Splitted label_event_byline into two in folder_summary_view.pt like in
        folder_listing.pt fixed in Plone 3.3rc1, this closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8358
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Removed spurious comma from unlockOnFormUnload.js which was causing
        Javascript errors in IE.  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9157
        [davisagli]
        
        - Splitted description_no_account msgid into two, heading_new_user msgid added.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Added Internet Explorer 8 support. We only load the workaround CSS file for
        IE7 and earlier now, Internet Explorer 8 parses the
        '<meta name="IE" content="EmulateIE8" />' header that forces it into standards
        mode on both intranets and public internet sites.
        [limi]
        
        - author.cpt should honour allowAnonymousViewAbout in the same way as
        document_byline, this closes http://dev.plone.org/old/plone/ticket/8560
        [elro]
        
        
        3.3rc2 - April 5, 2009
        ----------------------
        
        - Added an explicit return statement in the upgrade code for products without
        a GS profile. Thx to Vincent Fretin for the code review.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixing permissions typo in object_rename button, this closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9060
        [siebo]
        
        
        3.3rc1 - March 30, 2009
        -----------------------
        
        - New favicon.ico that is in line with the new branding.
        [limi]
        
        - author.pt: Fixed the #region-content mess, replaced modification date with
        created date (as that's what the table says it's listing), reduced to 5 items
        instead of 30 tables with 5 items each, made the table vertical.
        [limi]
        
        - batch_macros.pt: Added "current" class to current item, removed the brackets,
        added ellipses. Moved comments to a tal section to stop them from showing up
        in the source.
        [limi]
        
        - default_error_message.pt: Turned apostrophes into real apostrophes.
        [limi]
        
        - join_form.pt: Removed unnecessary fieldset.
        [limi]
        
        - logged_out.pt: Removed duplicate "new account" section (it's actually located
        in the login form).
        [limi]
        
        - login_form.pt: Moved Forgot/New out of the fieldset, fixed wording + added
        headline.
        [limi]
        
        - main_template.pt: Moved #content to main template instead of offloading its
        responsibility to the individual templates. This makes it easier to avoid
        duplication and make it possible to use it with Deliverance and similar
        theming approaches.
        [limi]
        
        - personalize_form.pt: Cleaned up the #content mismatch. No more double tabs.
        [limi]
        
        - search_form.pt: Removed unnecessary fieldset, inserted "searchform" id on
        form to not get it filled in as id="search" automatically.
        [limi]
        
        - Updated the custom indexes in CatalogTool.py to no longer depend on the
        'portal' keyword or kwargs, both of which are gone from plone.indexer.
        This is done in an effort to be forward-compatible with CMF 2.2. See
        the plone.indexer README for more details.
        [optilude]
        
        - Merged `safe-upgrade-button` branch. Instead of the removed `Reinstall`
        button in the `Add/Remove products` control panel, we now have an upgrade
        button for all products whose installation is driven by GenericSetup. This
        is based on GenericSetup upgrade steps.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed msgid label_event_byline default message which contained dynamic content.
        Created a label_event_byline_without_location used when you don't specify
        location in an Event.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Updated the custom indexes in CatalogTool.py to no longer depend on the
        'portal' keyword or kwargs, both of which are gone from plone.indexer.
        This is done in an effort to be forward-compatible with CMF 2.2. See
        the plone.indexer README for more details.
        [optilude]
        
        - Fixed the registerIndexableAttribute() backwards-compatibility shim to
        register named adapters.
        [optilude]
        
        - Re-added the 'getRemoteUrl' and 'link_remote' attributes of the navtree
        decorator, which were lost during the implementation of PLIP 126.  Note
        that these attributes are deprecated and will not be available in Plone 4.
        Custom navigation templates using these attributes should simply link to
        the Link object, whose default view now takes care of redirecting based on
        the value of the global 'redirect_links' property.

        - Make the Groups Overview search post back to the same page, since it displays a
        lot more useful information than the prefs_user_group_search, and fits more
        with the way the Users Overview works. Include a "Show all" button as well.

        3.3b1 - March 12, 2009
        ----------------------
        
        - Replace the workflow history portlet with a content history portlet
        for newly created sites. This implements PLIP 243.
        [wichert]
        
        - Changed most actions to now use the globals_view/navigationRootUrl. Updated
        the CMFCalendar tool override to allow the calendar portlet to allow passing
        in kwargs such as path.  Fixed skin templates and scripts to use the
        @@plone_portal_state/navigation_root_url instead of portal_url.
        This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/234

        - Removed CatalogTool.ExtensibleIndexableObjectWrapper in favour of the
        wrapper in plone.indexer, and made registerIndexableAttribute() a deprecated
        facade for registering an IIndexer adapter. See plone.indexer for more
        information about the correct (and more robust) way to register custom
        indexers.

        - Removed the `Reinstall` button from the `Add/Remove products` control panel.
        Users would constantly mistake it as an upgrade mechanism, which Plone does
        not yet support in a structured way.

        - Added an option in the Site Settings configlet to disable TTW locking
        entirely.  Also fixed a couple bugs with unlocking and made it so the
        lock gets refreshed as long as an editor is on the edit page.
        This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/240
        
        - Added a 'redirect_links' site property and corresponding 'Redirect
        immediately to link target' setting in the types configlet (for the Link type
        only).  The default view for the Link type has been changed to
        link_redirect_view.py from the plone_content skin layer, which redirects or
        falls back to the old link_view depending on the 'redirect_links' value.
        This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/126

        - "Mark external links" and "External links open in new window" were not working
        independently ('mark' had to be set for 'new window' to work) and marking could
        not be turned off at all (#7383). Fixed by having either one enable the js
        support and adding a new site property to control marking. Implemented so
        that new site property will be assumed false if missing and created on change
        if missing -- so no migration required. There is a matching change in
        plone.app.controlpanel.

        - PLIP 238: Disable inline editing for new Plone sites.

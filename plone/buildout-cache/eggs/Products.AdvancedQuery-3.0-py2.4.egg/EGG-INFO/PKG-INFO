Description: AdvancedQuery
        =============
        
        ``AdvancedQuery`` is a Zope product aimed to overcome several limitations
        and bugs of ``ZCatalog``'s native search function.
        
        Like ``ZCatalog`` search, it supports elementary index searches.
        While ``ZCatalog`` can combine such elementary searches only by "and",
        ``AdvancedQuery`` allows to arbitrarily combine them by ``&`` (and),
        ``|`` (or) and ``~`` (not). Besides, it supports an extended range
        of elementary queries, such as matching, indexed queries, literal
        result sets. Finally, it supports incremental filtering.
        
        ``AdvancedQuery`` also extends the sorting capabilities of
        ``ZCatalog``. ``ZCatalog`` supports efficient index based sorting
        on one level. ``AdavancedQuery`` supports sorting on arbitrary levels
        of field indexes. Furthermore, sorting is performed incrementally
        -- only as far as the result is accessed.
        This can drastically speed up sorting.
        Finally, ``AdvancedQuery`` can sort based on query based ranks.
        Unlike ``ZCatalog`` which simply ignores hits for which it does not
        have a sort value, ``AdvancedQuery`` sorts such hits at the end
        of the respective list.
        
        ``AdvancedQuery`` works best when used together with
        ``Products.ManagableIndex`` and ``dm.incrementalsearch``.
        Some of its features depend on these products, e.g. matching
        and incremental filtering. Furthermore, these additional
        components can speed up queries by several orders of magnitude.

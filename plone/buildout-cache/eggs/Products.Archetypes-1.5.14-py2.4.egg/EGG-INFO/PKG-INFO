Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Archetypes is a developers framework for rapidly developing and deploying
        rich, full featured content types within the context of Zope/CMF and Plone.
        
        Archetypes is based around the idea of an `Active Schema`. Rather than
        provide a simple description of a new data type, Archetype schemas do the
        actual work and heavy lifting involved in using the new type. Archetype
        Schemas serve as easy extension points for other developers as project
        specific components can be created and bound or you can choose among the
        rich existing set of features.

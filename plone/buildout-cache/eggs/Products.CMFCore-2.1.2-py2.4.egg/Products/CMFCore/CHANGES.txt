Products.CMFCore Changelog
==========================

------------------

- fiveactionstool: fix typo in a method name that isn't even used in the CMF 
  or Plone.

- test fixture: Fix failng tests with GenericSetup > 1.3 by explicitly
  loading GS' meta.zcml during setup.


2.1.2-beta (2008-08-26)
-----------------------

- completed devolution from monolithic CMF package into its component
  products that are distributed as eggs from PyPI.


2.1.1 (2008-01-06)
------------------

- exportimport.content: Add simple guard against import failures when
  the ".objects" file contains empty lines.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/176328)


2.1.1-beta (2007-12/29)
-----------------------

- Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.

- Updated to the 0.3 release of five.localsitemanager.

- Events: Fixed some handleContentishEvent issues.
  Moved _clearLocalRolesAfterClone code to separate handler that is
  triggered before indexing and also for folders. Made sure notifyModified
  is not called if objects are just moved.

- PortalObject: Added setSite to getSiteManager for old instances. This
  fixes migrations from Plone 2.1 to 3.0.

- FSImage: Supply class-level defaults for 'alt', 'height', and 'width',
  to avoid acquiring objects with the same names.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/507)

- Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.

- PortalObject: Fixed a bug in the site manager creation code, which would
  assign the __parent__ pointer to the Aq-wrapper and not the actual
  object.


2.1.0 (2007-08-08)
------------------

- Fixed all componentregistry.xml files to use plain object paths and strip
  and slashes. GenericSetup does only support registering objects which are
  in the site root.

- PortalFolder: Enabled 'Components' ZMI tab.
  This GenericSetup tab allows to inspect and edit component registrations.

- First egg release.  For changes up through this release, please see
  the overall "CMF changelog",
  http://svn.zope.org/CMF/tags/2.1.0/CHANGES.txt?rev=78713&view=markup


2.1.0-beta2 (2007-07-12)
------------------------

- moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.4

- Remove antique usage of marker attributes in favor of interfaces,
  leaving BBB behind for places potentially affecting third-party code.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/440)

- Add POST-only protections to security critical methods.
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0240)

- exportimport.skins: Added the ability to remove whole skin selections using a 
  GS profile.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/479)

- UndoTool: Fixed 'listUndoableTransactionsFor'.
  The required 'object' argument is now respected. This doesn't change the
  behavior as long as 'object' is the site root object.

- TypesTool: Corrected method signature of all_meta_types to have
  an interface keyword argument, as per the underlying OFS.ObjectManager
  interface declaration.

- SkinnableObjectManager: Changed the way skins are set up.
  Acquisition wrapping no longer triggers 'setupCurrentSkin'. This is now
  done on publishing traversal after the BeforeTraverseEvent triggers
  'setSite'. This fix replaces a temporary hack introduced in 2.1.0-beta,
  making sure ISkinsTool is looked up after setting the site.

- CMFBTreeFolder: CMFBTreeFolders could not be used as the
  toplevel /Members container.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/441)

- TypesTool: Pass 'object' through to TypeInformation objects'
  'listActions'.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/482)

- Removed extraneous "Cache" tab from FS-based skin objects.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/343)

- WorkflowTool: Using the '(Default)' keyword for a type's
  workflow chain will now reset any custom workflow chains for the type.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/475)

- SkinsTool: Use the property API to get the member specific skin,
  because direct attribute access won't work with PAS based membership.
  (http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5904)

- Allow customization from DirectoryViews to be redirected into
  alternate folders, and use manually-built clones.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/382)


2.1.0-beta (2007-03-09)
-----------------------

- moved the Zope dependency to verson 2.10.2

- Tool lookup and registration is now done "the Zope 3 way" as utilities, see
  http://svn.zope.org/CMF/branches/2.1/docs/ToolsAreUtilities.stx?view=auto

- DirectoryView: Added 'registerDirectory' ZCML directive.
  Using the old registerDirectory method in __init__.py is now deprecated.
  See zcml.IRegisterDirectoryDirective for details.

- DirectoryView: Added support for non-product packages.
  This introduces new registry keys. Old registry keys stored in
  persistent DirectoryView objects are updated on the fly.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/467)

- setup handlers: Improved properties handler.
  It now works with properties using a default_charset other than UTF-8.

- MembershipTool: Fixed inconsistent behavior where member lookup
  would take all user folders up to the Zope root into account whereas
  member area creation would not.

- MembershipTool: when using an object without a __nonzero__ but with a 
  __len__ (ala CMFBTreeFolder) as a member folder, the createMemberArea 
  method would believe there was no members folder if the folder was
  empty, and so would fail (change "not membersfolder" to
  "membersfolder is not None") .

- DynamicType: Fixed behaviour regarding default view.
  DynamicType was making it impossible to use a Zope3-style
  default view for CMF content types.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/459)

- utils: Marked 'minimalpath' and 'expandpath' as deprecated.

- Merged patches from Martin Aspeli to enable generating events before
  and after DCWorkflow transitions, and in the 'notify' methods of the
  workflow tool (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/461).


2.1.0-alpha2 (2006-11-23)
-------------------------

- moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.1

- Fixed test breakage induced by use of Z3 pagetemplates in Zope 2.10+.

- browser views: Added some zope.formlib based forms.

- testing: Added test layers for setting up ZCML.

- WorkflowTool: Added the IConfigurableWorkflowTool interface.
  This change includes the new 'getDefaultChain' and 'listChainOverrides'
  methods and an improved 'setChainForPortalTypes' method. The import
  handler now supports the 'remove' attribute for removing overrides.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/457)

- CachingPolicyManager: Implemented the old OFS.Cache.CacheManager
  API. Now objects other than CMF content or CMF templates can have their
  caching headers set by the caching policy manager with the same
  fine-grained control.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/408)

- Added CMFCore.FSRestMethod:  ReST equivalent of FSSTXMethod.

- FSSTXMethod:  Modernized, added tests, made customization
  possible (now renders via ZPT by default, using 'main_template').

- CachingPolicyManager: Prevent firing of caching policies
  for templates (DTML or ZPT) that are rendered in-line (without a
  separate request) while rendering the requested content item's view.
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/456)


2.1.0-alpha (2006-10-09)
------------------------

- skins: Changed encoding of translated portal_status_messages.
  Now getBrowserCharset is used to play nice with Five forms. Customized
  setRedirect and getMainGlobals scripts have to be updated.

- Profiles: All profiles are now registered by ZCML.

- ZClasses: Removed unmaintained support for ZClasses.
  Marked the 'initializeBases*' methods as deprecated.

- Content: Added IFactory utilities for all content classes.
  They are now used by default instead of the old constructor methods.

- Content: All content classes are now registered by ZCML.
  ContentInit is still used to register oldstyle constructors.

- setup handlers: Removed support for CMF 1.5 CMFSetup profiles.

- FactoryTypeInformation: Added support for Zope3 style factories.
  If the 'product' property of a type info instance is empty the 'factory'
  property is interpreted as an IFactory name.

- ActionInformation: don't use a fixed set of properties for
  ActionInformation. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/232/)

- CatalogTool: Use current executable's proxy roles, if any,
  in place of user's roles when computing 'allowedRolesAndUsers' for
  a query. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/380)

- FSFile: Added registration for 'txt' extension.

- CMFCatalogAware: Added 'handleObjectEvent' subscriber.
  This replaces the deprecated 'manage_afterAdd', 'manage_afterClone' and
  'manage_beforeDelete' hooks.

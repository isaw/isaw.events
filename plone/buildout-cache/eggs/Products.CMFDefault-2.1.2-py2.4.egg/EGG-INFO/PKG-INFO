        Products.CMFDefault Changelog
        =============================

        - SyndicationTool: Removed obsolete documentation link from the
        Overview ZMI tab.
        (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/185090)
        
        
        2.1.2-beta (2008-08-26)
        -----------------------
        
        - completed devolution from monolithic CMF package into its component
        products that are distributed as eggs from PyPI.
        
        - File, Image:  Make the ZMI edit tab work.
        
        - DiscussionItem: Fixed indexing of 'in_reply_to'.
        
        
        2.1.1 (2008-01-06)
        ------------------
        
        - PropertiesTool: Fix a faulty manage_changeProperties
        invocation which broke the 'Reconfigure Portal' screen
        (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/174246)
        
        
        2.1.1-beta(2007-12/29)
        ----------------------
        
        - Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.
        
        - CMFDefault profiles: Fixed some dependencies in import_steps.xml.
        
        - utils: The email validation would reject addresses where
        the domain part started with a single letter element.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/495)
        
        - skins: Prevented the getMainGlobals script to fail if not
        content-type header is set.
        
        
        2.1.0 (2007-08-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed all componentregistry.xml files to use plain object paths and strip

        in the site root.
        
        - utils: Allow email addresses with all-numeric domain names.
        The RFCs do not support them but they do exist.
        (http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6773)
        
        
        2.1.0-beta2 (2007-07-12)
        ------------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.4
        
        - Remove antique usage of marker attributes in favor of interfaces,
        leaving BBB behind for places potentially affecting third-party code.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/440)
        
        - Add POST-only protections to security critical methods.
        http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0240)
        
        - Use a utility, registered for
        'Products.CMFDefault.interfaces.IHTMLScrubber', to perform scrubbing
        of HTML;  fall back to the old, hard-wired behavior.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/452)
        
        - Favorite: Fixed UID handling broken in 2.1.0-beta.
        
        - Removed CMFUid dependency inadvertently added in 2.1.0-beta.
        
        - GS integration: Adjusted factory.py to new GenericSetup version.
        
        
        2.1.0-beta (2007-03-09)
        -----------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to verson 2.10.2
        
        - Tool lookup and registration is now done "the Zope 3 way" as utilities, see
        http://svn.zope.org/CMF/branches/2.1/docs/ToolsAreUtilities.stx?view=auto
        
        - Document: Added two new methods for safety belt handling.
        
        - MembershipTool: when using an object without a __nonzero__ but with a
        __len__ (ala CMFBTreeFolder) as a member folder, the createMemberArea
        method would believe there was no members folder if the folder was
        empty, and so would fail (change "not membersfolder" to
        "membersfolder is not None") .
        
        - File and Image: Restored ZMI Cache tab which was lost in CMF 1.6.
        
        
        2.1.0-alpha2 (2006-11-23)
        -------------------------
        
        - moved the Zope dependency to version 2.10.1
        
        - Fixed test breakage induced by use of Z3 pagetemplates in Zope 2.10+.
        
        - browser views: Added some zope.formlib based forms.
        
        - testing: Added test layers for setting up ZCML.
        
        - Added zope.formlib support.
        This includes some CMF specific base classes and an 'EmailLine' field.
        
        - utils: Added 'checkEmailAddress' function.
        
        - Portal: Added 'email_charset' property.
        
        - utils: Added 'makeEmail' function.
        
        - Image and File: Overridden index_html methods
        add Cache Policy Manager-awareness and thus bring these implementations
        in line with CMFCore.FSFile and CMFCore.FSImage
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/454)
        
        - RegistrationTool: Fixed too restrictive email checking.
        The new 'checkEmailAddress' function is now used.
        
        - skins: Fixed encoding issues in welcome and reminder emails.
        'password_email' and 'registered_email' now encode their return value
        correctly, using 'email_charset' and the new 'makeEmail' function.
        
        
        2.1.0-alpha (2006-10-09)
        ------------------------
        
        - skins: Changed encoding of translated portal_status_messages.
        Now getBrowserCharset is used to play nice with Five forms. Customized
        setRedirect and getMainGlobals scripts have to be updated.
        
        - Profiles: All profiles are now registered by ZCML.
        
        - ZClasses: Removed unmaintained support for ZClasses.
        Marked the 'initializeBases*' methods as deprecated.
        
        - Content: Added IFactory utilities for all content classes.
        They are now used by default instead of the old constructor methods.
        
        - Content: All content classes are now registered by ZCML.
        ContentInit is still used to register oldstyle constructors.
        
        - setup handlers: Removed support for CMF 1.5 CMFSetup profiles.
        
        - utils: Added getBrowserCharset function.
        Returns the charset preferred by the browser. Strings encoded with this
        charset are decoded correctly by Five.browser.decode.processInputs.
        
        - Favorite: Added 'handleFavoriteAddedEvent' subscriber.
        This replaces the 'manage_afterAdd' hook and some code in 'addFavorite'.

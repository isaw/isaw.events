  http://svn.zope.org/CMF/branches/2.1/docs/ToolsAreUtilities.stx?view=auto

- Document: Added two new methods for safety belt handling.

- MembershipTool: when using an object without a __nonzero__ but with a 
  __len__ (ala CMFBTreeFolder) as a member folder, the createMemberArea 
  method would believe there was no members folder if the folder was
  empty, and so would fail (change "not membersfolder" to
  "membersfolder is not None") .

2.1.0-alpha2 (2006-11-23)

- utils: Added 'checkEmailAddress' function.

- Portal: Added 'email_charset' property.

- utils: Added 'makeEmail' function.

- Image and File: Overridden index_html methods
  add Cache Policy Manager-awareness and thus bring these implementations
  in line with CMFCore.FSFile and CMFCore.FSImage
  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/454)

- RegistrationTool: Fixed too restrictive email checking.
  The new 'checkEmailAddress' function is now used.

- skins: Fixed encoding issues in welcome and reminder emails.

2.1.0-alpha (2006-10-09)
------------------------

  Now getBrowserCharset is used to play nice with Five forms. Customized

  Marked the 'initializeBases*' methods as deprecated.

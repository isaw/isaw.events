        About
        =====
        
        NuPlone is a "taste of things to come", as much as an example of how
        radically different a theme for Plone can look, using just CSS.
        
        It's a design exploration meant to inform the next-generation default Plone
        look, but it's also usable in its own right.
        
        In addition, it serves as a good example of advanced CSS styles in Plone:
        
        - It is much cleaner and more compact than the old Plone CSS, which has
        grown to become quite bloated over the last 5 years. If you want to learn
        about CSS and Plone, this is a great starting point.
        
        - It's an example of a static layout as opposed to the fluid layout of
        default Plone.
        
        - It is logically grouped and well-commented.
        
        - It's much smaller (~25K uncompressed!)
        
        Tips
        ====
        
        NuPlone is a bit different from the standard theme, and the following tweaks
        will help you get closer to what the designers intended:
        
        - Add the search portlet as the topmost portlet in the left column.
        
        - Turn off icon display in "Theme settings".
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        Being a new theme, this hasn't received the amount of testing and quality
        assurance that has gone into the default Plone theme over the years, so we
        suspect there are bugs in various browsers, especially in Internet Explorer.
        
        It is also implemented on top of the standard table-for-layout setup in the
        default theme - please note that it's easy to make this theme tableless if
        you should wish to do so. We have to ship something that is more robust in
        broken browsers like Internet Explorer by default, though.
        
        If you find any bugs (or even better: solutions for these bugs), please
        report them in the "Plone issue tracker", selecting 'NuPlone theme' as the
        component.
        
        We hope you like it!
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0b3 - January 12, 2008
        ------------------------
        
        - Put in workaround for IE6 background caching problem, closes
        https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7445, thanks cwainwright
        [calvinhp]
        
        - Added missing metadata.xml to uninstall profile.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added uninstall profile and hooked to GS
        [MatthewWilkes]
        
        - Removed DIYPloneStyle tests as they were almost all broken.  Now tests
        install, CSS and JS entries, and uninstall, but not modifications to default
        views, etc.  This is no loss as these tests didn't work anyway, as they
        assumed a non-GS installation style.
        [MatthewWilkes]
        
        - Installed nuplone.css with lower precedence than RTL.css after inserting
        RTL.css before ploneCustom.css.  Added test to check for RTL.css
        precendence over nuplone.css.
        Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7177
        [emanlove]
        
        - Moved info bar on portal message to the right for RTL.

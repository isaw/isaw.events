Description: Changelog
        =========
        
        3.12 - 2009-10-16
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed the performance fix again. enumerateUsers from mutable_properties
        plugin should return all the users if kw is empty. And it returns empty
        tuple if login or id parameter is used.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.11 - 2009-10-05
        -----------------
        
        - Revert performance fix introduced in 3.10 for the mutable properties plugin.
        enumerateUsers shouldn't return results if id or login is not None like in
        3.9 (data dict doesn't contain id or login key, so testMemberData returns
        always False). The search should be performed only if kw parameter is not
        empty. This is the new optimization fix.
        [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.10 - 2009-09-06
        -----------------
        
        - Performance fix for searching in the mutable properties plugin:
        when only searching on user id do not walk over all properties,
        but only test if the user id is known. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9361
        [toutpt]
        
        - Nested groups are now visible in prefs_group_members. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8557
        [vincentfretin]
        
        - Add sort and merge PASSearchView's interface to prevent code duplication.
        [csenger]
        
        
        3.9 - 2009-04-21
        ----------------
        
        - Fix the cookie plugin's login handler to not trust the username
        from the request. Instead we use the login name of the currently
        authenticated user. This fixes CVE-2009-0662 (see
        http://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/cve-2009-0662
        for more information).
        [wichert]
        
        
        3.8 - 2009-02-13
        ----------------
        
        - Update the role manager's assignRoleToPrincipal method to lazily
        update the cached list of portal roles. This fixes problems with
        adding users with GenericSetup-created roles.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fixed our OrderedDict to be unpickable with pickle protocol 2. On
        unpickling a __init__ method is not called and an optimization in
        protocol 2 would call __setitem__ without the _list to be initialized.
        Even using a __getstate__ / __setstate__ combination wouldn't work
        around that. This change was found in using membrane and
        MemcachedManager.
        [hannosch, tesdal]
        
        
        3.7 - 2008-09-28
        ----------------
        
        - Removed deprecation zcml statements for PluggableAuthService components:
        these are now in PluggableAuthService itself.
        [wichert]
        
        - Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
        since we changed the version numbering again.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        3.6 - 2008-06-25
        ----------------
        
        - Modify PloneGroup.getMemberIds to use all IGroupIntrospection plugins
        to get the group members. This makes it possible to list members in
        an LDAP group.
        [wichert]
        
        
        3.5 - 2008-06-25
        ----------------
        
        - Make PASSearchView.merge actually merge search results. Its previous
        behaviour was quite nasty: it preferred search results from the
        enumeration plugin with the lowest priority!
        [wichert]
        
        
        3.4 - 2008-03-26
        ----------------
        
        - Added BBB code for changed setLoginFormInCookieAuth upgrade method.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Ignore but log users without passwords during migration from pre-PAS, as
        these cannot be added to any standard user source.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix listRoleInfo on the role plugin to also lazily update the list
        of portal roles.
        [wichert]
        
        3.3 - 2007-03-07
        ----------------
        
        - Added metadata.xml file to the profile.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Move global role lookup out of the local role plugin. Part of the
        PLIP 127 merge for Plone 3.1.
        [alecm]
        
        
        3.2 - 2008-02-15
        ----------------
        
        - Fix schema handling for ZODBMutablePropertyProvider initialization.
        [maurits]
        
        - Remove some exception swallowing from the installation logic so errors
        are not hidden.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Correct handling an empty roles list when modifying groups.
        This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6994
        [rsantos]
        
        
        3.1 - 2007-10-08
        ----------------
        
        - Improve handing of sorting for searches.
        [csenger]
        
        - Updating the roles for a group did not invalidate the _findGroup cache.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fixed some tool icons to point to existing icons.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0 - 2007-08-16
        ----------------
        
        - Fix check for authenticateCredentials return value
        [rossp]
        
        
        3.0rc2 - 2007-07-27
        -------------------
        
        - Fake a getPhysicalPath on our search view so ZCacheing works properly
        everywhere.
        [wichert]
        
        - Add event classes for logged-in and logged-out events.
        [wichert]
        
        
        3.0rc1 - 2007-07-08
        -------------------
        
        - Correct logic in MemberData capability methods: any plugin is
        allowed to (re)set a password, delete the user or add roles.
        [wichert]
        
        - Use the proper API to get the containing PAS in the group plugin
        [wichert]
        
        - Fix setting user properties on the user object.
        [wichert]
        
        
        3.0b7 - 2007-05-05
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the five:registerPackage statement again. It causes problems in a
        ZEO environment.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Removed our version of the Plone tool from ToolInit. It won't get an icon
        anymore and you cannot add it, but existing instances still work. We
        migrate all instances back to the regular tool anyways.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0b6 - 2007-05-05
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed two migration related test failures.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Spring cleaning, removed some cruft, pyflaked and corrected some more
        undefined names.
        [hannosch]
        
        - New package layout, following standard Python package conventions.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed tool names in ToolInit, so the permission has a proper name. This
        closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6525.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        3.0-beta5 - 2007-05-02
        ----------------------
        
        - Modify the roles plugin to lazily update its roles list from the portal.
        [wichert]
        
        - Filter duplicate search results.
        [laz, wichert]
        
        - Add a sort_by option to the search methods to allow sorting of results
        by a property.
        [laz, wichert]
        
        - Modify login method for the cookie plugin to perform the credential
        update in the PAS of the user instead of the PAS of the plugin. This
        helps in making sure that users will only authenticate against their
        own user folder, so we get all their roles, properties, etc. correctly.
        [wichert]
        
        - Update installation logic to use plone.session for cookies
        [wichert]
        
        - Add pas_info and pas_search browser views.
        [wichert]
        
        - Deprecate the PlonePAS PloneTool; its changes have been merged in the
        standard Plone version.
        [wichert]
        
        - Use getUtility to get the portal object.
        [wichert]
        
        - Deprecate user and group searching through CMF member and group tools
        in favour of PAS enumeration.
        [wichert]
        
        - Refactor user searching in the membership tool to use standard PAS
        searches.
        [wichert]
        
        - Add user enumeration capabilities to the mutable properties plugin.
        [wichert]
        
        - Add a new automatic group plugin which puts all users in a virtual
        group. This is useful for permissions handling: since it is not
        possible to add roles to users with the Authenticated role a
        virtual group can be used instead.
        [wichert]
        
        - Added support to import PloneUserFactory and added stub
        for ZODBMutableProperties. Attention: Latter needs a real
        export and import! At the moment it do not export the
        propertysheets. This is a TODO. At least with this two
        additions PlonePAS import runs. Additional I needed to
        hack PluginRegistry and and PluggableAuthService slightly.
        [jensens]
        
        - Added HISTORY.txt and updated version information.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        2.4 - 2007-04-15
        ----------------
        
        - Optomise the local roles plugin for the common case where
        local_roles is empty
        [dreamcatcher]
        
        - the plone user was assuming a one to one mapping between property plugin
        and user property sheet, and stripping away additional ones as part of
        the retrieval of ordered sheets, instead, it now stores all
        propertysheets in an ordered dictionary, so this assumption is not needed
        [k_vertigo]
        
        - More postonly security changes
        [alecm, ramon]
        
        
        2.3 - 2007-05-30
        ----------------
        
        - Use a local postonly decorator so PlonePAS can be used with Plone
        2.5, 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.
        [wichert]
        
        - Protect the tools with postonly security modifiers.
        [mj]
        
        - Update GRUF compatibility functions to use the same security checks
        as GRUF itself uses.
        [mj]
        
        - Fix migration to handle properties of selection or multiple selection
        types.
        [reinout]
        
        - Correct creation of groups wich default group managers.
        [dreamcatcher]
        
        - Fix migration from GRUF sites: also include the member properties in the
        migration.
        [tesdal]
        
        - Correct the test for creation of groups with the same id as users: search
        for the exact id, not substrings.
        [tesdal]
        
        - Fix bad form action which made it impossible to add a plone user factory
        plugin through the ZMI. Backported from trunk.

        PluggableAuthService changelog
        ==============================
        
        PluggableAuthService 1.6.1 (2006-11-20)
        ---------------------------------------
        
        - Launchpad #273680:  Avoid expensive / incorrect dive into 'enumerateUsers'
        when trying to validate w/o either a real ID or login.
        
        - Launchpad #300321:  ZODBGroupManager.enumerateGroups failed to find
        groups with unicode IDs.
        
        PluggableAuthService 1.6 (2008-08-05)
        -------------------------------------
        
        - Fixed another deprecation for manage_afterAdd occurring when used
        together with Five (this time for the ZODBRoleManager class).
        
        - Ensure the _findUser cache is invalidated if the roles or groups for
        a principal change.
        
        - Launchpad #15569586:  docstring fix.
        
        - Factored out 'filter' logic into separate classes;  added filters
        for 'startswith' test and (if the IPy module is present) IP-range
        tests.  See https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-pas/+bug/173580 .
        
        - Zope 2.12 compatibility - removed Interface.Implements import if
        zope.interface available.
        
        - Ensure ZODBRoleManagerExportImport doesn't fail if it tries to add a
        role that already exists (idempotence is desirable in GS importers)
        
        - Fixed tests so they run with Zope 2.11.
        
        - Split up large permission tests into individual tests.
        
        - Fixed deprecation warning occurring when used together with
        Five. (manage_afterAdd got undeprecated.)
        
        - Added buildout.
        
        
        PluggableAuthService 1.5.3 (2008-02-06)
        ---------------------------------------
        
        - ZODBUserManager plugin: allow unicode arguments to
        'enumerateUsers'. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-pas/+bug/189627)
        
        - plugins/ZODBRoleManager: added logging in case searchPrincipial()
        returning more than one result (which might happen in case of having
        duplicate id within difference user sources)
        
        
        PluggableAuthService 1.5.2 (2007-11-28)
        ---------------------------------------
        
        - DomainAuthHelper plugin:  fix glitch for plugins which have never
        configured any "default" policy:  'authenticateCredentials' and
        'getRolesForPrincipal' would raise ValueError.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/59)
        
        
        PluggableAuthService 1.5.1 (2007-09-11)
        ---------------------------------------
        
        - PluggableAuthService._verifyUser: changed to use exact_match to the
        enumerator, otherwise a user with login 'foobar' might get returned
        by _verifyUser for a query for login='foo' because the enumerator
        happened to return 'foobar' first in the results.
        
        - Add a test for manage_zmi_logout and replace a call to isImplementedBy
        with providedBy.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/58)
        
        
        PluggableAuthService 1.5 (2006-06-17)
        -------------------------------------
        
        - Add support for property plugins returning an IPropertySheet
        to PropertiedUser. Added addPropertysheet to the IPropertiedUser.
        
        - Added a method to the IRoleAssignerPlugin to remove roles from a
        principal, and an implementation for it on the ZODBRoleManager.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/57)
        
        - Added events infrastructure. Enabled new IPrincipalCreatedEvent and
        ICredentialsUpdatedEvent events.
        
        - Added support for registering plugin types via ZCML.
        
        - Implemented authentication caching in _extractUserIds.
        
        - Ported standard user folder tests from the AccessControl test suite.
        
        - Passwords with ":" characters would break authentication
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/51)
        
        - Corrected documented software dependencies
        
        - Converted to publishable security sensitive methods to only accept
        POST requests to prevent XSS attacks.  See
        http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/Hotfix-2007-03-20/announcement and
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6310
        
        - Fixed issue in the user search filter where unrecognized keyword
        arguments were ignored resulting in duplicate search entries.
        (http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6300)
        
        - Made sure the Extensions.upgrade script does not commit full
        transactions but only sets (optimistic) savepoints. Removed bogus
        Zope 2.7 compatibility in the process.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/55)
        
        - Made the CookieAuthHelper only use the '__ac_name' field if
        '__ac_password' is also present. This fixes a login problem for
        CMF sites where the login name was remembered between sessions with
        an '__ac_name' cookie.
        
        - Made the DomainAuthHelper return the remote address, even it the
        remote host is not available (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/PAS/49).
        
        - Fixed bug in DelegatingMultiPlugin which attempted to validate the
        supplied password directly against the user password - updated to use
        AuthEncoding.pw_validate to handle encoding issues
        
        - Fixed serious security hole in DelegatingMultiPlugin which allowed
        Authentication if the EmergencyUser login was passed in.  Added
        password validation utilizing AuthEncoding.pw_validate
        
        - Fixed a set of tests that tested values computed from dictionaries
        and could break since dictionaries are not guaranteed to have any
        sort order.
        
        - Fixed test breakage induced by use of Z3 pagetemplates in Zope
        2.10+.
        
        - BasePlugin: The listInterfaces method only considered the old-style
        __implements__ machinery when determining interfaces provided by
        a plugin instance.
        
        - ZODBUserManager: Already encrypted passwords were encrypted again in
        addUser and updateUserPassword.
        (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/1926)
        
        - Made sure the emergency user via HTTP basic auth always wins, no matter
        how borken the plugin landscape.
        
        - cleaned up code in CookieAuthHelper which allowed the form to override
        login/password if a cookie had already been set.
        
        - Removed some BBB code for Zope versions < 2.8, which is not needed
        since we require Zope > 2.8.5 nowadays.

Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ZopeSkel provides a collection of skeletons for quickstarting Zope
        and Plone projects.
        
        All skeletons are available as PasteScript_ templates and can be used
        via the ''paster'' commandline tool. For example to create a package
        for a Plone 3 theme you can do::
        
        paster create -t plone3_theme
        
        this will ask a few questions such as desired package name and a description
        and output a complete package skeleton that you can immediately start using.
        
        Please contribute by submitting patches for what you consider 'best of
        breed' file layouts for starting Zope projects.

        Available templates
        ===================
        
        Development templates
        ---------------------
        plone
        This is a small template which creates a bare bones package with a
        single namespace. This can be used to create plone.* packages
        for example.
        
        plone_app
        This is a small template which creates a bare bones package with a
        nested namespace. This can be used to create plone.app.* packages
        for example.
        
        plone3_portlet
        Creates a package with a new portlet. This includes everything needed
        to register the portlet in Plone and tests which check if the portlet can
        be added, edited and rendered properly.
        
        plone2_theme
        A template to create a new Zope 2 products for a Plone 2.1 or Plone 2.5
        site. If you are targetting Plone 3 please use the plone3_theme template
        instead.
        
        plone2.5_theme
        A template to create a new Zope 2 products for Plone 2.5
        site. If you are targetting Plone 3 please use the plone3_theme template
        instead.
        
        plone3_theme
        This template creates a theme package for Plone 3.0. This is the succesor
        to the popular DIYPloneStyle_ product.
        
        recipe
        This template creates a recipe skeleton for zc.buildout.
        
        
        .. _DIYPloneStyle: http://plone.org/products/diyplonestyle
        
        
        Hosting / deployment templates
        ------------------------------
        
        plone2.5_buildout
        A basic buildout_ based instance for Plone 2.5 projects. If you also need
        ZEO or caching take a look at the plone_hosting template.
        
        plone3_buildout
        A basic buildout_ based instance for Plone 3.0.x projects. If you also need
        ZEO or caching take a look at the plone_hosting template.
        
        plone_hosting
        This template creates a buildout_-based Plone deployment. It supports
        all Plone 2.5 and 3.0 versions: it will ask you for the desired Plone
        version.
        
        If you configure a proxy port a varnish_ cache server will be installed
        and configured as well.
        
        supervisord_ is used to manage the ZEO server, Zope instance and, if chosen,
        Varnish server.
        
        silva_buildout
        A basic buildout Silva instance.

        Testing
        -------
        
        Since version 1.5, ZopeSkel has tests.  It's required to run these
        before checking in; they can be run like::
        
        $ python setup.py test
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.11 - February, 5th
        --------------------
        
        * Make the Plone 3 buildout default to Plone 3.2.1, and pick up
        ${versions:zope2-url} for Plone > 3.1
        [MatthewWilkes]
        
        * added a version requirement for Cheetah (>1.0)
        [tarek]
        
        * fix zopeskel/docs/localcommands.txt
        [yboussard]
        
        * Modify zopeskel/templates/plone/+namespace_package+/+package+/tests.py_tmpl
        to init egg as product if it is a Zop e2 product.
        [yboussard]
        
        * Modify plone3_buildout template to ask for a Plone version. If the version
        is 3.0 or 3.1 it uses the plone install recipe, otherwise it uses the Plone
        egg from the cheeseshop.
        [MatthewWilkes]
        
        * Link to appropriate PyPI pages for recipes used.
        [MatthewWilkes]
        
        * Add a Zope 2 without Plone buildout template.
        [evilbungle]
        
        * Reconciling HISTORY.txt to mirror what can be found at the following:
        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZopeSkel/2.10. Release of 2.10 was clobbered
        due to what looks like a merge at r74790.
        [andrewb]
        
        * Update plone2.5_template's buildout.cfg_tmpl to use Zope 2.9.10. This
        release incorporates Hotfix-2008-08-12. Defaulting to a known insecure
        Zope seems unwise for people that may be updating legacy environments into
        buildout, since they're likely to forget to include the hotfix. Url to
        2.9.10 hard-coded (as opposed to the more elegantly self-aware
        plone.recipe.plone approach) per the practice of a plone.recipe.distros
        plone part.
        [andrewb]
        
        * Nearly at the end of the creation of a ZopeSkel template, the local
        commands available for that template are displayed.
        [jaraco, markvl]
        
        * The Plone template now has local commands. (Basically moved them
        from the archetype templates to plone templates and made them
        available for both.
        [markvl]
        
        * Added base test setup to the archetype template. Added wiring code that
        runs README.txt as a doctest.
        [esartor]
        
        * Added tests to the addcontent contenttype command. These ammend the
        README.txt file for each content type providing basic tests for creating,
        editing and removing instances of the added content type.
        [esartor]
        
        
        2.10 - September, 17th
        ----------------------
        
        * Fixed a small bug that made most templates create a package that was
        * showing twice in the Plone quick
        installer is the top level namespace package was called 'Products'. Bug
        was fixed in the 'plone' template (since version 1.5), now in other ones
        where needed too.
        [davconvent]
        
        
        2.9 - September, 1st
        --------------------
        
        * Update silva buildout to reflect changes in Silva 2.1 as stable
        version, and 2.2 as development: SilvaLayout is not shipped anymore
        as an extra distribution but integrated in Silva all. Remove
        question, and update buildout.cfg template.
        [thefunny]
        
        2.8 - July 31, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Generate logrotate configuration file using collective.recipe.template
        so it does not need to contain absolute paths. This makes it possible
        to move the generated buildout around, or install it on other machines
        with different filesystem layouts.
        [wichert]
        
        * Also rotate instance1-Z2.log.
        [wichert]
        
        * Update documentation for hosting template to note that logrotate needs
        to be told where to put its status file.
        [wichert]
        
        
        2.7 - July 25, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
        - Switch default Plone version to 3.1.4.
        [wichert]
        
        - Corrected a typo in the logrotate template, which prevented the zeo log
        to be rotated.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        2.6.2 - July 16, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
        - Corrected even more references of instance to instance1 in proxy support
        and logrotate handling.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        2.6.1 - July 16, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
        - Changed the http_port to start at base_port + 10, to make room for
        additional services.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Corrected hide_summary option, to not show the summary twice.
        [hannosch]
        
        2.6 - July 15, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
        - Corrected one last reference of instance to instance1 in the zopepy eggs
        option of the plone_hosting template.
        [hannosch]
        
        2.5 - July 15, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
        - fix test for Varnish-support in the supervisord configuration.
        [wichert]
        
        - Rename the instance part to instance1 and add an instances group. This
        makes it possible to upgrade to multiple instances later on without
        having to break invocations.
        [wichert]
        
        2.4 - July 9, 2008
        ------------------
        
        * Restore the cwd after running buildout in the hosting recipe so further
        processing works correctly.
        [wichert]
        
        * Add a hook in the hosting template to not show the summary. This
        can be used by derived templates that want to show their own summary
        or show it at a later point.
        [wichert]
        
        * Set default Plone version to 3.1.3.
        [wichert]
        
        * Added kss plugin template
        [gotcha, jfroche, adrien01]
        
        * Silva layout have been merged with Silva all in the development
        buildout.
        [thefunny]
        
        2.3 - June 24, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Fix problem in the hosting template: varnish was always enabled
        even if not desired.
        [wichert]
        
        * Added ZopeSkel test layer with the apropriate testSetup and testTearDown.
        The steps in the top of each test file is not anymore needed: delete
        tempdir/plone.example and then cd to tempdir.
        [mustapha]
        
        * Make the zope2product option in the archetype template default to true.
        [mustapha]
        
        * Modified buildout.cf to only test zopeskel.
        [mustapha]
        
        * Fixed the paster test function: overwrite option should default to True for
        the create command.
        [mustapha]
        
        * Added ``use_local_commands`` attribute (a la use_cheetah). A zopeskel
        template that wants to use local commands has to set it to True .
        [mustapha]
        
        * Get rid of zopeskel.txt and use setup.cfg to store the parent template name.
        [mustapha]
        
        * Sub-templates may define a parent_template attribute with the list of
        templates that can use it.
        [mustapha]
        
        * Fixed tests and updated docs.
        [mustapha]
        
        Version 2.2
        -----------
        
        * Install Plone 3.1.2 by default.
        [wichert]
        
        * Remove useless spans from the portlet template.
        [wichert]
        
        * Add supervisorctl configuration.
        [wichert]
        
        
        Version 2.1
        -----------
        
        * Revert BaseTemplate usage from the hosting template (changeset
        57368 from Tarek). It was not used and broke the buildout. This fixes
        http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/8
        [wichert]
        
        * Replace the generic README in the plone_hosting template with documentation
        that is important for deployments.
        [wichert]
        
        * Add log rotation support to the hosting buildout. Merged from Jarn's
        bones package.
        [wichert]
        
        
        Version 2.0
        -----------
        
        * Switch plone_hosting template to using supervisord to manage processes.
        Merged from Jarn's bones package.
        [wichert]
        
        * Reduced the number of questions to generate an atschema and used
        the MessageFactory instead of declaring an i18n_domain attribute
        [mustapha]
        
        * Fixed missing imports in plone2_theme
        [mustapha]
        
        * Removed unused imports in plone_pas
        [mustapha]
        
        * In plone2.5_theme: when the skinname is empty, replace it with a
        default text, otherwise adding a Plone Site will throw an error when
        displaying the extension profiles.
        [maurits]
        
        * Added note to profiles.zcml of plone2.5_theme that
        five.registerPackage needs Five version 1.4.
        [maurits]
        
        * Added a BUILDBOT.txt file.
        [tarek]
        
        * plone3_portlet: added commented out alternative AddForm for when
        there are no configurable parameters.  That was shorter than listing
        all the changes (where we forgot one).
        [maurits]
        
        * Fixed typos in archetyps and plone3 portlets: 'portletBotomLeft'
        should have been 'portletBottomLeft' with two 't's.
        [maurits]
        
        * Made plone3_portlet respect pep8 (and pyflakes).
        [maurits]
        
        * Use 1.0 as default version number for all templates. This is a more sensible
        default than 0.1 since we start of with dev-versions anyway.
        [wichert]
        
        * sub-templates per ZopeSkel template: Only sub-templates related to the parent
        template is visible with the -l option
        [mustapha]
        
        * added -a (--list-all) option to show all subtemplates regardless of the
        current project. Subtemplates that are not for the type of the current
        project are prefixed with N
        [mustapha]
        
        * Fixed the recreation of the paster_plugins.txt metadata file for archetype.
        For now we have to run 2 times the egg_info command to get the paster_plugins
        file recreated (setuptools problem: nice task to fix)
        [mustapha]
        
        * fixed the case of many inner packages: ask the user to choose a packe to
        inject content into if the command is run outside of an inner package
        [mustapha]
        
        * make all ZopeSkel templates that inherits from BaseTemplate addcontent aware
        [mustapha]
        
        * Added plone_pas template for PlonePas projects and many subtemplates
        [mustapha]
        
        * regrouped archetype subtemplates in templates/archetype
        [mustapha]
        
        * added and fixed tests
        [mustapha]
        
        
        Version 1.10
        ------------
        
        * Install Plone 3.1.1 as default option.
        [wichert]
        
        * Fixed a problem with ZopeSkel localcommands when we have multiple
        projects, it was getting the first directory always and sometimes
        the package dir was not the first directory, so when running the
        addcontent in the package it was creating the contents in the wrong
        dir. Thanks to wichert for pointing me this file.
        [dsa]
        
        * Update the hosting template to make running of buildout optional.
        [wichert]
        
        * Update the hosting template to test if a port is already in use and
        abort if so.
        [wichert]
        
        * Update the hosting template to only ask for a single base port number.
        [wichert]
        
        * Fix broken creation of Plone 3.1(.x) sites.
        [wichert]
        
        
        Version 1.9
        -----------
        
        * Install Plone 3.1 as default option.
        [wichert]
        
        * Fixed a missing 'import os' in the plone2_theme template. [davisagli]
        
        * Fix an ambiguous question in the silva_buildout template, and update
        the generated README file. [thefunny]
        
        
        Version 1.8
        -----------
        
        * fixed the recipe template buildout.cfg generation, thanks Kai ;)
        [tarek]
        
        Version 1.7
        -----------
        
        * Update the templates to have README.txt and HISTORY.txt in valid
        restructured format and use those as the package's long description.
        This automatically gives packages a more readable page on PyPI
        (and PSC with Tarek's excellent changes).
        [wichert]
        
        * Adjust the trove classifiers on the packages to not claim incorrect
        frameworks: we should only claim frameworks on which the package
        can run directly. So, for example, do not claim Zope2 of we also need
        Plone on top of Zope2.
        [wichert]
        
        
        Version 1.6
        -----------
        
        * Add templates for a Silva buildout.
        [thefunny]
        
        * Add a metadata.xml to all generated GenericSetup profiles. This is
        required by new versions of GenericSetup.
        [wichert]
        
        * For nested namespace packages we need to declare both namespace
        levels as namespace packages. This is a requirement for current
        versions of setuptools.
        [wichert]
        
        * Use Plone 3.0.6 as default version for new Plone hosting buildouts
        [wichert]
        
        
        Version 1.5.1
        -------------
        
        * Fix #2 (missing import in 'hosting.py') at
        http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/2

        Version 1.5
        -----------
        
        * added a new local command into archetype template to inject
        new content types [spanky]
        
        * added a doctest for each template, and refactored the package
        so we have one python module per template [tarek]
        
        * Refactored the zc.buildout recipe to provide structured documention
        that will render nicely on PyPI, added comments for recipe authors
        to help writing documentation and tests and added a working doctest
        skeleton. Implemented automatic license classifiers for common
        licenses in the generated setup.py. The mapping is in zopeskel.base
        and can be used for other templates also.
        [dokai]
        
        * The 'five:registerPackage' ZCML directive is added in a project based on the
        'plone' template only if the top level namespace package is not
        called 'Products'. This avoids having the product loaded twice in Zope.
        [davconvent]
        
        * Added paragraph about old style Zope 2 Product installation in the
        INSTALL.txt_tmpl file of the plone template.
        The paragraph will be added to the installation instructions if the top
        level namespace package is called 'Products'.

        Version 1.4
        -----------
        
        * Set the version number for plone.recipe.plone in a new versions part in
        buildout.cfg. That works around a buildout bug: buildout breaks if you change
        the revision pin for a recipe.
        [wichert]
        
        * Fixed bug: when running 'paster create' with --no-interactive option,
        the package variable given in the command line is ignored.

        Version 1.3.4
        -------------
        
        * Added MANIFEST.in to prevent bad releases from svn exports.
        [fschulze]
        
        Version 1.3.3
        -------------
        
        * Move to the newly released Varnish 1.1.2.
        [wichert]
        
        * Remove bad import which broke localcommand support.
        [deo]
        
        * Remove unneeded imports and whitespace cleanup.
        [deo]
        
        Version 1.3.2
        -------------
        
        * Small fix in plone3_theme that did not install correctly with easy_install
        because of some files missing the the egg informations (added MANIFEST.in).
        [davconvent]
        
        Version 1.3.1
        -------------
        
        * Added 'addcontent' local command to make possible injecting content types
        in ZopeSkel projects and make the Archetype template 'addcontent' aware.
        [mustapha]
        
        * Updated to Plone 3.0.4.
        [fschulze]
        
        * Rerelease because of a bad egg.
        [fschulze]
        
        Version 1.3
        -----------
        
        * added the `recipe` template
        [tarek]
        
        * Add Plone 2.5.5.
        [wichert]
        
        Version 1.2
        -----------
        
        * Merge a slightly stripped down version of the Jarn Plone hosting template.
        This provides a convenient way to create a buildout for all Plone 2.5 and
        3.0 versions with ZEO and optional Varnish based caching.

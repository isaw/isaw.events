        2.0.1 Released July 31st, 2008
        
        - Support caching of allowed local roles on the request.
        [witsch]
        
        - Renamed the default adapter to "default" so that people don't
        accidentally override it with an unnamed adapter. Overriding the default
        should be possible, but is a marginal use case. If it's overridden but
        not replicated properly, all sorts of problems can result.
        [optilude]
        
        - Added exportimport.zcml which registers TitleOnlyExportImport for
        WorkspaceLocalRoleManager; this allows local roles plug-in to be
        imported and exported as part of a GenericSetup profile.

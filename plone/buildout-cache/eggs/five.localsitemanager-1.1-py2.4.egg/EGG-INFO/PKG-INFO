Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        five.localsitemanager attempts to provide a local site manager implementation
        that is as close to Zope 3's implementation as possible. Some reservations
        that do not conflict with Zope 3 have been made to ease the path with CMF.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        * Zope 2.10.x or newer
        
        * setuptools_
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Place the ``five`` top-level package into your instance's
        ``lib/python`` directory.  You can also install it as an egg using
        easy_install_, for example into your instance by turning it into a
        workingenv_.
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Place a ``five.localsitemanager-configure.zcml`` file into your instance's
        ``etc/package-includes`` directory with the following contents::
        
        <include package="five.localsitemanager" />
        
        Also setup a ``five.localsitemanager-overrides.zcml`` file into your instance's
        ``etc/package-includes`` directory with the following contents::
        
        <include package="five.localsitemanager" file="overrides.zcml" />
        
        Running the Tests
        -----------------
        
        Use the following command to run this package's tests:
        
        $ bin/zopectl test -s five.localsitemanager
        
        .. _workingenv: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/workingenv.py

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.1 - 2009-06-19
        ----------------
        
        * Don't prefer using __parent__ over using aq_parent() to find the parent when
        looking for a registry. This causes nasty acquisition infinite recursion
        because doing getattr(obj, '__parent__') when obj supports implicit
        acquisition gives you back the parent acquisition-wrapped in the child.
        It's not a problem until some parent *doesn't* have a __parent__ pointer,
        at which point we end up trying to use aq_parent() and get into a loop.
        [optilude]
        
        * Made zope.component 3.5 support official and adjusted tests.
        
        1.0 - 2008-11-18
        ----------------
        
        * Utilities registered with an absolute path were returned with the
        RequestContainer in the aq_chain. As the result of the first utility
        look-up is stored in the adapter look-up cache, subsequent utility
        look-ups return the utlitiy with the RequestContainer of the first
        look-up.
        
        Solution: For utilities registered with an absolute path the
        RequestContainer is now also removed at look-up.

        1.0c1 - 2008-08-27
        ------------------
        
        * Added buildout for project, so testing can be done using ``bin/test``.
        [icemac]
        
        * Added ability to register utilities with an absolute path. These
        utilities are returned wrapped into their original context. This
        change is backward compatible to existing registries.
        
        But registering utilities having an acquisition context will behave
        different because these utilities will be returned in their original
        context. To restore the previous behavior, register utilities
        unwrapped (aq_base).
        
        For storing path information the component must implement
        getPhysicalPath and have an absolute path.
        
        When a component registered as utility is moved and registered again
        the path stored in registry gets updated.

        0.4 - 2008-07-23
        ----------------
        
        * Rewrite PersistentComponents.registeredUtilities to not use
        internal methods. This makes it compatible with both zope.component <3.5.0dev
        and >3.5.0dev.
        [wichert]
        
        
        0.3 - 2007-12-24
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed potential aq problem when assigning various values to the utilities
        registry of the component registry.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        0.2 - 2007-06-30
        ----------------
        
        * Refactored and fixed aq wrapping: Nested site managers now return utilities
        wrapped in the right context. RequestContainers are removed and wrapped
        utilities are cached. This requires a special LookupClass called
        'FiveVerifyingAdapterLookup' in all 'utilities' registries used below a
        five.localsitemanager site.

        0.1.2 - 2007-06-23
        ------------------
        
        * Corrected the zip-safe flag to be False.
        
        
        0.1.1 - 2007-03-05
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed aq wrapping when looking up a utility that is actually the component
        registry's parent (the ISite).
        
        
        0.1 (2007-02-27)
        ----------------

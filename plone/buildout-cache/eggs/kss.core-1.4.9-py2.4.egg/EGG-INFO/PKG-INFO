        Kinetic Style Sheets (KSS) kss.core
        ***********************************
        
        KSS is an Ajax framework that allows UI development without writing any
        Javascript. It uses style sheets with CSS-compliant syntax to declare and bind
        dynamic behaviors in the browser. The engine supports a set of generic DOM-like
        commands; they are computed on the server and sent back to manipulate the HTML
        page.
        
        What is KSS?
        ************
        
        KSS is an AJAX framework. KSS has both a client-side Javascript library and
        server-side support.
        
        The client-side Javascript library needs to be included in your page. It
        fetches Kinetic style sheets from the server, parses them and binds a set of
        action to browser events and/or page elements. It is clean Javascript code that
        can peacefully coexist with other clean Javascript librarys like JQuery or
        ExtJS. It is about 100k in production mode. You can integrate your own
        Javascript code by using its extension mechanism through plugins.
        
        Server-side code is currently available for Zope (2 and 3, which includes
        Plone). The kss.base egg (which is currently in alpha) brings server-side
        support to other pythonic platforms, such as:
        
        * pylons
        * django
        * grok
        
        The Javascript client-side code can be used independently of existing
        server-side support. In other words, it is usable on platforms where we have
        not built server-side support like PHP, Ruby or Java. (If you have interest in
        porting KSS to the server environment you use and need help, please contact us
        !)

        Recently changed
        ================
        
        
        
        New in kss 1.4.8
        ----------------
        
        - new client action ``setActionServerTimeout``
        
        It allows to setup timeout separately for each server action.
        You call it in the stylesheet just before the server action.
        It has a ``value`` parameter where you specify the timeout in
        milliseconds::
        
        div.timeout:click {
        action-client: setActionServerTimeout;
        setActionServerTimeout-value: 10000;
        action-server: bla;
        }
        
        You can also use it to change the global default timeout value at body
        load time::
        
        body:load {
        action-client: setActionServerTimeout;
        setActionServerTimeout-value: 5000;
        }
        
        
        New in kss 1.4
        --------------
        
        - Major code refactoring, for better readibility and speedups.
        
        - Lots and lots of ecma unittests and selenium tests that test kss.core
        and the core plugin, are added. All are checkable from a single click
        from any browser.
        
        - New and improved demos
        
        - Base2 is used for css selection, instead of the original cssQuery (if
        present). Significantly faster page load.
        
        - multiple selectors in the same rule are allowed, ie.::
        
        selector1:click selector2:click { ... }
        
        or even::
        
        selector1:keyup selector2:keydown { ... }
        
        - Value providers can be recursive, ie.::
        
        nodeAttr(kssAttr(blah))
        
        is allowed.
        
        - added url() special value provider, the first is alternate syntax for::
        
        action-server: blah;
        blah-kssUrl: "http://foo.bar/blahblah";
        
        you can now say in one line::
        
        action-server: blah url(http://foo.bar/blahblah);
        
        This may be handy if you want to call @@ url-s.
        
        - added alias() special value provider, this enables using more client
        actions on the same node::
        
        action-client: setAttribute;
        setAttribute-key: foo;
        setAttribute-value: bar;
        action-client: setAttribute alias(other);
        other-key: foo2;
        other-value: bar2;
        
        - enable node selection in the same line as the action specification, ie.
        instead of::
        
        action-client: foo;
        foo-kssSelector: css(div.klass);
        
        you can also say::
        
        action-client: foo css(div.klass);
        
        - enable full form submits in the same line as the action specification,
        ie. instead of::
        
        action-server: foo;
        foo-kssSubmitForm: currentForm();
        
        you can also say::
        
        action-server: foo currentForm();
        
        - Value providers can be used also in the "event binder id", eg.
        instead of the static binder id::
        
        xxxxx:click(blah) { ... }
        
        a dynamic binder id can also be used::
        
        xxxxx:click(kssAttr(blah)) { ... }
        
        This feature is needed for upcoming use cases like drag and drop.
        
        - Remove previously deprecated form() and
        currentForm() value providers from normal
        action parameters (remark: they should now
        be used with xxx-kssSelector or directly on the action-client line as
        described above, and they properly support Zope multiform
        fields like :list, :record, :records.)
        
        - Demos and selenium tests are removed from kss.demo and are now placed
        together with the plugin in kss.core. This means, all 3rdparty plugins
        should now have a zope-only demo page with a selenium test, if the
        plugin is loaded the demo appears in the index and the test is run
        together with all tests. (Demos can be viewed and tested by kss.demo.)
        We also have kss.template that creates a skeleton kss plugin with
        all bells and whistles.
        
        - Implement loglevels based on cookies (also backported to 1.2.)
        
        - Other fixes (also backported to 1.2):
        
        - Fix error fallback handling
        
        - Fix multiple selection form fields marshalling on Safari and IE
        
        - Fix setKssAttribute action and command
        
        - fix action-cancel
        
        Deprecated in kss 1.4
        ---------------------
        
        form() and currentForm() in normal value providers
        """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
        
        currentForm()
        '''''''''''''
        
        
        You must change rules that use currentForm() in a normal value provider::
        
        action-server:                     myServerAction;
        myServerAction-data:               currentForm();
        
        to::
        
        action-server:                     myServerAction currentForm();
        
        Or, if you want to keep compatibility with kss 1.2::
        
        action-server:                     myServerAction;
        myServerAction-kssSubmitForm:      currentForm();
        
        
        form()
        ''''''
        
        Similarly, for form(), you must change the following::
        
        action-server:                     myServerAction;
        myServerAction-data:               form();
        
        to::
        
        action-server:                     myServerAction form();
        
        Or, if you want to keep compatibility with kss 1.2::
        
        action-server:                     myServerAction;
        myServerAction-kssSubmitForm:      form();
        
        
        Necessary server side changes
        '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        On the server side, the method that received the form as a dictionary in one
        parameter, must define the values directly in the method signature, or access
        them from the form directly.
        
        So the following old code::
        
        def method(self, data):
        field1 = data['field1']
        field2 = data.get('field2', None)
        
        must be changed in one of the two ways shown in the following examples::
        
        def method(self, field1, field2=None):
        ...
        
        An alternate way is to get them from the request::
        
        def method(self):
        request = self.request
        field1 = request.form['field1']
        field2 = request.form.get('field2', None)
        
        Known problems
        --------------
        
        Safari 3.1 fails to run with KSS. The problem is with base2,
        that fails selecting any selector that contains capital letters.
        
        Example for header of browser version that experiences the problem::
        
        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_2; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1 Safari/525.13
        
        
        Old cssQuery.js works for this browser, so a workaround is to ensure
        that Safari 3.1 gets the cssQuery.js resource and not the base2.
        
        For example, in ResourceRegistries, the following changes are needed:
        
        Resource: cssQuery.js
        
        - Enable
        - Change condition to: here/@@kss_devel_mode/needs_old_cssquery
        
        Resource: ++resource++base2-dom-fp.js
        
        - Change condition to: not: here/@@kss_devel_mode/needs_old_cssquery
        
        This enables the correct behaviour, since KSS always uses the
        library it founds (in the priority of base2 and the old cssquery).

        -----------------------
        
        - refactor the value provider registry to use
        a single registry in place of 3.
        This will enable to define value
        providers that recieve non-string parameters
        like a node selection.
        [ree]
        
        - Remove previously deprecated form() and
        currentForm() value providers from normal

        - Refactor code towards module and class closures.
        in kukit.js [gotcha]
        
        - Fix multiple selection form fields
        marshalling on Safari
        (fixes #22 in kssproject)
        and on IE.
        [ree]
        
        - Fix error fallback handling
        [ree]
        
        - Implement loglevels based on cookies
        Add handling of log levels to the kss mode view
        [ree]
        
        - Moved the core demos to this package from kss.demo.
        They are now located under the core plugin.
        [ree]
        
        - Implement event binding based on the ids fetched
        dynamically from the dom, by value providers.
        [ree]
        
        - Changed kukit payload to encode HTML content of CDATA.
        This was necessary because us a supposed bug in FF, that
        prevented us to use base2 (xpath selection did not work
        on inserted elements, due to namespace issues.)
        Get rid of forceToDom, make sure all plugins accept html
        parameters as strings.

        [ree]
        
        - Death to Azax (... long live KSS)!
        Removing last traces of the old name from the sources
        [gotcha]
        
        - Changed querying for css selectors to base2 instead of
        cssQuery. Base2 is supposed to be a lot faster than
        the old cssQuery. Usage is alternating, if base2 is
        present that one is used, otherwise it uses the old
        cssQuery code which stays the default.
        [jvloothuis, ree]
        
        - Add moveNodeBefore action (presumably missing)
        [ree]
        
        - Refactor load event, separate iload and load events.
        The new event binder handles both events together. A
        new parameter, evt-iload-autodetect is introduced, if
        this is false we don't use detection but the iframe
        must cooperate on telling us wnen we are done.  There
        is deprecation warning issued for the load events, if
        bound on an iframe, in which case an iload event must
        be used.
        [ree]
        
        - refactor event binding to allow different iterators to bind
        events in a binder instance, matching the need of the events.
        [ree]
        
        1.2-beta2
        ---------
        
        - Make the binding of the nodes together in one batch
        [ree]
        
        - added kssSubmitForm action parameter
        and deprecation
        [ree]

        ---------
        
        - Prepare for release
        [ree]
        
        1.2-alpha2
        ----------
        
        - Merge in Philikon's refactorization
        Move docs to doc/
        [ree]
        
        - Initial package structure.

        ------------------
        
        - Added blur action (which, as it doesn't need a parameter, requires the

        - Fix or improve calculateAbsoluteURL to handle absolute
        and relative urls correctly, as well as get rid of the
        double slash (//) issue.
        It also satisfies the tests kss_url_param and
        kss_url_param_multiprop, that now work as intended,
        with previous workaround removed.
        [ree]
        
        - Replaced license header of third-party sarissa.js
        to workaround the license detection of ohloh.

        - Fix a typo that caused an exception instead of
        logging an error message, this happened when

        [ree]

        [ree]
        
        1.4-alpha1 (2008-03-09)
        -----------------------
        
        - refactor the value provider registry to use
        a single registry in place of 3.
        This will enable to define value
        providers that recieve non-string parameters
        like a node selection.
        [ree]
        
        - Remove previously deprecated form() and
        currentForm() value providers from normal
        action parameters (remark: they should
        be used with kssSelector.)
        They now give a parsing error.
        [ree]
        
        - Implement multiproperties in
        action-client and action-server
        [ree]
        
        - add url() and alias() providers
        [ree]
        
        - Use functions in token table instead of code strings
        that were evaluated. 'eval' is very slow.
        [gotcha]
        
        - Refactor code towards module and class closures.
        [gotcha]
        
        - Fix multiple selection form fields marshalling on Safari
        (fixes #22 in kssproject) and on IE.
        
        - Fix multiple selection form fields
        marshalling on Safari
        (fixes #22 in kssproject)
        and on IE.
        [ree]
        
        - Fix error fallback handling
        [ree]
        
        - Implement loglevels based on cookies
        Add cookie handling code to kss.dom
        Change logging on FireBug to avoid line info in debug
        level messages
        [ree]
        
        - Implement event binding based on the ids fetched
        dynamically from the dom, by value providers.
        [ree]
        
        - Store some data on HTML nodes for FireKiss
        [gotcha]
        
        - Enhance javascript exception, they now properly show
        the place where the exception generated, and also the
        annotated error reasons of kss.
        [jvloothuis, ree]
        
        - Allow multiple selectors separated with commas for a single
        set of property in a rule
        [gotcha, laz, jfroche]
        
        - Changed kukit payload to encode HTML content of CDATA.
        This was necessary because us a supposed bug in FF, that
        prevented us to use base2 (xpath selection did not work
        on inserted elements, due to namespace issues.)
        Get rid of forceToDom, make sure all plugins accept html
        parameters as strings.
        [ree, jvloothuis]
        
        1.2 (2007-08-17)

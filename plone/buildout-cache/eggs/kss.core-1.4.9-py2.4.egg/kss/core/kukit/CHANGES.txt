      with previous workaround removed.

----------------

    - Updated base2-dom-fp.js with newest version.

1.4-alpha1 (2008-03-09)
-----------------------

    - refactor the value provider registry to use
      a single registry in place of 3.
      This will enable to define value
      providers that recieve non-string parameters
      like a node selection.
      [ree]

    - Remove previously deprecated form() and
      currentForm() value providers from normal
      action parameters (remark: they should
      be used with kssSelector.)
      They now give a parsing error.
      [ree]

    - Implement multiproperties in
      action-client and action-server
      [ree]

    - add url() and alias() providers
      [ree]

    - Use functions in token table instead of code strings
      that were evaluated. 'eval' is very slow.
      [gotcha]

    - Refactor code towards module and class closures.
      [gotcha]

    - Fix multiple selection form fields marshalling on Safari 
      (fixes #22 in kssproject) and on IE.

      [ree]

    - Implement loglevels based on cookies

      dynamically from the dom, by value providers.
      [ree]

    - Store some data on HTML nodes for FireKiss
      [gotcha]

    - Enhance javascript exception, they now properly show
      the place where the exception generated, and also the
      annotated error reasons of kss.
      [jvloothuis, ree]

    - Allow multiple selectors separated with commas for a single
      set of property in a rule
      [gotcha, laz, jfroche]

    - Changed kukit payload to encode HTML content of CDATA.
      This was necessary because us a supposed bug in FF, that
      prevented us to use base2 (xpath selection did not work
      on inserted elements, due to namespace issues.)
      Get rid of forceToDom, make sure all plugins accept html
      parameters as strings.
      [ree, jvloothuis]

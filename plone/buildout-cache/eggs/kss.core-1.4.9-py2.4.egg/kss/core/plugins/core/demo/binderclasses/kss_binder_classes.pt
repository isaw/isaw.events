    <h2>Binder classes handling</h2>

    <p>The followings are checked in this demo:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>inheritence must work with event binder classes.</li>
      <li>If the constructors of the binder class set up variables on this.XX, these will 
      be properties of the _instance_, not that of the class.</li>
      <li>If two events are bound on the same binder class, they are considered the same 
      class in the registry. That is, if the events are bound on the same instance 
      id (or the singleton), they will see a shared state.</li>
    </ul>

    <input type="submit" id="alpha1" class="buttons"
      value="alpha1">

    <input type="submit" id="beta1" class="buttons"
      value="beta1">

    <input type="submit" id="beta2" class="buttons"
      value="beta2">
  
    <br />

    <p metal:use-macro="context/@@body_macros/logger">logger</p>

    <p>When you click button alpha1, logging of count should start
    from 50. When you click beta1 or beta2, counting starts from 100.
    Alpha and beta are independent, but beta1 and beta2 share the same
    clicking state.

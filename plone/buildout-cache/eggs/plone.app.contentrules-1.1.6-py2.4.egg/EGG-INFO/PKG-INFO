        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.1.6 - May 16, 2009
        --------------------
        
        - Add check to see if getTypeInfo can be None (which is a valid value)
        [tesdal]
        
        - Changed the simplepublish test to use a copy instead of a move action.
        The move action causes the content item to be moved away while editing
        it and causes a NotFound error. In Plone 3 this is hidden by the
        customized NotFound handling.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed GenericSetup tests layer to not pollute the general test
        environment.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Modified a macro call in contentrules-pageform.pt for forwards
        compatibility with Zope 2.12.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Fixed a SyntaxError in test_configuration.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1.1 - April 18, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        - Added proper unicode handling to mail action. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7650.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Made the GS import handlers more tolerant in case the storage utility
        is missing. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8133.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Changed wording on the IMailAction interface to remove a reference to a
        newly created item, since the action can be used on existing content
        as well. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8225.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1 - April 20, 2008
        --------------------
        
        - Ensure that if a contentrules.xml step is imported twice, conditions and
        actions are not duplicated.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8027
        [optilude]
        
        - Fix invalid leading space in all 'Up to Site Setup' links.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.0a1
        -------
        
        - Fixed a small bug related to getTypeInfo() being acquired.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7385
        [optilude]
        
        - Fixed bug causing content rule actions/conditions to not be properly
        saved.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7909
        [optilude]
        
        - Merge PLIP 204 - GenericSetup support. A contentrules.xml file can now
        be used to import and export rule definitions and assignments.
        [optilude]
        
        
        1.0.5
        -----
        
        - Made absolute_url() work properly on the custom adding views. This is
        necessary for the <base /> URL to be set correctly.
        [optilude]
        
        - Made absolute_url() work across the namespace traversal adapters for
        rules, actions and conditions, at time resorting to some serious
        Cowboy Development.
        [optilude]
        
        - Adjusted tests for different payload in newer kss versions.

        [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the portal type condition to use the ReallyUserFriendlyTypes
        vocabulary. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6911.

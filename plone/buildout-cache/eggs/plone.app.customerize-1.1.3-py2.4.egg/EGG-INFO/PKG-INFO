        Overview
        --------
        
        This package integrates five.customerize_ into Plone, which enables site
        administrators to customize templates used for five/zope3-style views,
        viewlets and portlets through the web via the ZMI in a way similar to
        overriding filesystem-based skin elements via the portal skin "customize"
        procedure.

        1.1.3 Released December 7th, 2009
        
        - Backport performance improvement for registrations page from 1.2
        [MatthewWilkes]
        
        - Fixed a test failure caused by changed HTML markup.

        1.1.2 Released July 10, 2008
        
        - Fixed a deprecation warning by using reg.factory instead of reg.value.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Changed encoding of view registration requirements again, in order to
        properly support portlet renderer templates and fix issue #8275 which
        broke customerize in most cases.  Now *all* the requirements are used.
        [davisagli]
        
        1.1.1 Released July 7, 2008
        
        - Re-enable browsertest introduced in r12928 after David's fix for the
        long-standing security issue (see #6196 and #8154)
        [witsch]
        
        - Fixed request type lookup to use the second requirement for a view
        registration rather than the last.  This making it possible to
        customerize viewlet and portlet templates registered with the same
        name for multiple z3 browser layers.  See test introduced in r21154.
        [davisagli]

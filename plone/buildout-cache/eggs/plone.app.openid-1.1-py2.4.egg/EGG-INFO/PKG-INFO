Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This packages makes Plone a complete OpenID consumer, allowing people
        to authenticate in a site using their OpenID identity. It relies on the
        plone.openid_ package to implement authentication of identities and
        needs an external session management plugin such as plone.session_ to
        add session management.
        
        You also need version 2.2.x of the python-openid_ package from JanRain. If this
        package is not installed you will not be able to install OpenID support in
        Plone.

        Installation
        ============
        
        If all requirements have been installed you should see an *OpenID
        Authentication Support* appearin the *Add/Remove Products* page in
        the Plone site setup screen. Installing the OpenID authentication
        support will do several things:
        
        * the PAS user folder is reconfigured to support OpenID authentication
        * an OpenID login portlet is added to the left column
        * the standard login form is replaces with a form which supports both
        OpenID logins and standard username&password logins

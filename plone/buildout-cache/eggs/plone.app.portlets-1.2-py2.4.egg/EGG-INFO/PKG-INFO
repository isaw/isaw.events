Description: Introduction
        =============
        
        plone.app.portlets provides a Plone-specific user interface for
        plone.portlets, as well as a standard set of portlets that ship with Plone.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2 - July 13, 2009
        -------------------
        
        - Fix ComponentLookupError on portlet management screen for special use cases
        such as collective.portletpage, where not all content have the same
        managers.
        [optilude]
        
        - Template cleanup: add missing xmlns declarations and fix invalid markup.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.2rc3 - April 8, 2009
        ----------------------
        
        - Correct import error in editmanager.py.
        [optilude]
        
        - Correct case in the feedparser dependency.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.2rc1 - March 27, 2009
        -----------------------
        
        - Added a permission check to portlets' add view.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8510
        [optilude]
        
        
        1.2b1 - March 7, 2009
        ---------------------
        
        - Fixed the various portlets to no longer use portal_url, but use the
        navigation_root_url from the plone_portal_state view. Changed the
        manage-dashboard view to be available on an INavigationRoot.
        This implements http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/234
        [calvinhp]
        
        - Removed portlets/feedparser.py.  Added FeedParser as external
        requirement in setup.py instead of shipping with it.
        (This is Plip 197: http://plone.org/products/plone/roadmap/197)
        [maurits]
        
        - Added title option to the RSS portlet.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Clean-up unnecessary variable declarations within navigation_recurse.pt.
        Let the default view on the Link type decide what's best
        [andrewb]
        
        1.1.7 (Unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed exportimport to support xml CDATA, thanks to lucie
        [calvinhp]
        
        1.1.6 - 2009-03-07
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed new portlet template footer so it will validate, fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8769 thanks to bandigarf
        [calvinhp]
        
        - Made the test independent of default content created in a site. This
        allows them to pass in both Plone 3.x and 4.x.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added inherited portlets to manage view. This implements
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8426.
        [malthe]
        
        - Modified a macro call in portlets-pageform.pt for forwards
        compatibility with Zope 2.12.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Fixed SyntaxErrors in test_cache and test_configuration.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed Review List template that was making a bad call to
        pretty_title_or_id. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8401.
        [dunlapm]
        
        1.1.5 (2008-08-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Refactored the review portlet a bit and added the review state dependent
        color coding to it. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6957.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Sort the addable portlets in the management screen by their title.
        This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8227.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Disabled two tests for a not yet implemented feature regarding better
        i18n support.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1.3 (2008-07-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix an accidental bug I introduced earlier: restore portletBottomLeft
        and portletBottomLeft spans in the news portlets with a more-news
        link.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.2 (2008-06-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed i18n markup.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7068#comment:4
        [naro]
        
        - The portletNavigationTree class was used for both the dl and the top
        ul. This makes things inconsistent since other levels in the tree
        used a navTree class for the ul, and uses the same class for two
        semantically very different items. Fixed by using navTree for the top
        ul as well.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.0 (2008-04-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Added test for #7942. The fix is in plone.app.layout.
        [optilude]
        
        - Fixed #8025 so that the named feeds now work to. Changed the package to
        use a different field.
        [mrtopf]
        
        - ViewPageTemplate is meant to be used as a class variable and only
        works as instance variable by accident in current Zope. This fixes
        errors in Philipp and Hanno's aq refactor branch of Zope2.
        [wichert]
        
        - Add a test to demonstrate #6100 and #7860. This is fixed in
        plone.portlets already.
        [optilude]
        
        - Use the new GenericSetup.components blacklist feature when available.
        This gives our exportimport code full control over all components
        providing either IPortletType, IPortletManager or
        IPortletManagerRenderer. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7149.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fix invalid leading space in all 'Up to Site Setup' links.
        [wichert]
        
        - Added tests for the (not yet implemented) i18n markup support in
        portlets.xml.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added missing i18n markup to portlets.xml.
        [hannosch]
        
        - label_group_members was used twice.  Renamed the second one to
        label_group_portlets (which is in plone.pot already).
        [maurits]
        
        - Removed last remains of caching for the navigation portlet.
        This closes https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7726.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added first day of week to calendar portlet cache key.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added option to purge all assignments specified by category and key.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Added option to remove individual portal managers and purge global
        portlet manager assignments as well as assignments to the site root
        with GS profiles.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Added option to purge portlet configuration in extension profiles.
        [fschulze]
        
        
        1.1.0a1 (2008-03-09)
        --------------------
        
        - Fixed bug that caused includeTop not to be set when a navtree portlet
        was first added.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7798.
        [optilude]
        
        - Made the language portlet's 'available' property work properly, avoiding
        ugly blank columns.
        [optilude]
        
        - Made sure the manage portlets div is not shown to anonymous users.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7911.
        [optilude]
        
        - Optimised the news portlet template.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7760
        [optilude]
        
        - Made the <plone:portletRenderer /> directive more forgiving.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7703
        [optilude]
        
        - Fixed a silly bug in the search portlet.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7388.
        [optilude]
        
        - Made it possible to remove single portlet assignments by using the
        "remove" attribute.
        [fschulze]
        
        - PLIP203: Add the ability to export and import portlet assignments and
        blacklisting.
        [optilude]
        
        - PLIPs 205 and 218: Allow registering portlet types to multiple portlet
        manager interfaces, require portlet types to be explicitly registered
        for portlet manager interfaces, enable modifying registrations through
        GenericSetup, and restrict most default Plone portlet types to left/
        right/dashboard columns.
        [sirgarr]
        
        - PLIP207: Allow custom portlet managers, i.e., allow specifying an
        alternative portlet manager class through GenericSetup.
        [sirgarr]
        
        
        1.0.7 (UNRELEASED)
        ------------------
        
        - Allow non-ASCII object paths while calculating cache key for
        portlets.  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7086
        [nouri]
        
        - Make the language portlet handle languages without a native name
        correctly.
        [wichert]
        
        - Do not link to news_listing from the news portlet: that template has
        been removed from Plone. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7872
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.0.6
        -----
        
        - Sort the languages in the language portlet using their native name.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fixed None value in query_string in calendar portlet. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7331.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed logic error in getRootPath in the last change.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Only show the language portlet if more than one language is available.
        This brings it in sync with the language selection viewlet.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fix missing variable on the language portlet renderer. This fixes
        NuPlone which relies on the language selector portlet.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fixed undefined variable name introduced in the last change.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Correct getRootPath to not add a trailing / to paths if there
        are no context subelements. This was breaking webcouturier.dropdownmenu
        in situations where one of the sections was a navigation root.
        [wichert]
        
        1.0.5
        -----
        
        - Made absolute_url() work properly on the custom adding views. This is
        necessary for the <base /> URL to be set correctly.
        [optilude]
        
        - Handle RSS feed entries which do not have an update timestamp correctly.
        This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7515
        [wichert]
        
        - Provide proper 'id' implementations for assignment mappings and
        assignments. This makes absolute_url() work properly.
        [optilude]
        
        1.0.2
        -----
        
        - Always try to refresh the RSS feed when rendering it instead of waiting
        for KSS to do trigger an updated. This is needed for the very common
        situation where most users are anonymous and the the feeds would expire
        (or never be loaded) and never (re)loaded.
        [wichert]
        
        - Add a language selection portlet.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fixed i18n markup bug in manage-content-type.pt.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Made prevMonth and nextMonth links in calendar portlet to work without
        KSS. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7052.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Make render_cachekey include the manager and assignment names, otherwise
        portlets that happen to have the same brains in their _data have the same
        cachekey.
        [ldr]
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        - Remove use of login javascript methods.
        [ree]
        
        - Change event portlet to use getIcon. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5075.
        [limi]
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - Add footer CSS classes to the search portlet. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6908.
        [wichert]
        
        - Verified translation of month names on the calendar portlet. Found a bit
        of missing i18n markup in the process. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6880.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Wrapped cached render results with a xhtml_compress method taken from
        plone.memoize. This allows you to plug in whitespace removal libraries.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Refactored calendar portlet and moved all calculations to the update
        method instead of doing it in its init.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Use relative links on the calendar portlet for the previous and next
        links, so the portlet can be cached independent of the context.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned up some templates, added missing i18n markup. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6721.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed erroneous wording in add screen for classicportlet.
        Fixes https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6703
        [elvix]
        
        - Extended the portlet migration machinery to exclude the deprecated
        related and language portlets. This refs
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6545.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Cleaned and speeded up calendar portlet. Extinguished some unneeded
        uses of the DateTime module.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed tests to deal with the new default start_level of the navigation
        portlet.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Made the workflow state to show configurable for the news and events
        portlets. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/1395.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Changed the default navigation tree configuration to start at level 1,
        thus there is no longer an overlap with the global navigation section at
        the top. If you want the old behavior back, configure the portlet to
        start at level 0.
        [limi]
        
        - Updated migration code to handle more converted portlets.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Do now show the login portlet if there is no login/password PAS
        extractor configured.
        [wichert]
        
        - Changed 'More news...' to 'More...' on RSS portlet as RSS feeds are not
        always news related. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6228.
        [sparcd]
        
        - Added <thead> tags to calendar portlet because the <tbody> tags were
        causing it to fail W3C validation.
        [sparcd]
        
        - Duplicate classes in login.pt were causing this to fail W3C HTML checks.
        Have merged the classes as this has a style="display:none" on it anyway.
        This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6241.
        [sparcd]
        
        - Replaced getToolByName with getUtility.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Moved class name from a to li tag for Cornelius (NuPlone skin).
        [jvloothuis]
        
        - Make URLs more ploneish, by removing .html at the end. .html really
        should be reserved for when people create content that way, e.g. if
        uploading from WebDAV. :)
        [optilude]
        
        - Initial implementation.

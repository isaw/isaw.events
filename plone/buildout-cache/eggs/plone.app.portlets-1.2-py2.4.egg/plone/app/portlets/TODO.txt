plone.app.portlets to-do
========================
  
  Decisions
  
    o May need a way to filter addable portlets by permission (e.g. some
        portlets are only available to some groups of users)
        
    o Category mappings are created on-the-fly in the namespace traversal
      adapters, which many not be ideal (even though these are protected by
      ManagePortal)
      
        - may be sufficient to create when the management views are invoked

    o ++dashboard++ probably only applicable to USER_CATEGORY
        - may want to imply more restrictions on category for different portlet
          manager types
        
  Portlets

    o Make standard set of portlets
        - Smart Folder renderer
        - Document renderer
          
  GenericSetup import/export handlers

    o Better test coverage for portlet manager GenericSetup import/export
        - export
        - re-import with purge
        - re-import without purge
      
    o Extend import/export handler to cover portlet assignments?

Description: Overview
        ========
        
        A collection of generally useful vocabularies for usage in zope.formlib.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0.6
        -----
        
        - Made the tests forward-compatible with Python 2.6.
        [hannosch]
        
        - The QuerySearchableTextSourceView made terms with string titles. However
        zope.app.form.browser.source assumes it to be unicode, with the result that
        you get unicode errors if you have non-ascii characters. [regebro]
        
        
        1.0.5 - August 18, 2008
        -----------------------
        
        - Documentation updates.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0.4 - March 9, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        - Added option to omit the current folder in a browse query, this is used
        for the UberSelectionWidget.
        [fschulze]
        
        
        1.0.3 - February 13, 2008
        -------------------------
        
        - Added tests for the catalog, groups and users sources. Fixed three bugs,
        where a LookupError was not raised.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added tests for the special term classes.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added tests for the language, security, skins, types and
        workflow vocabularies.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0.2 - December 24, 2007
        -------------------------
        
        - Fixed invalid context argument passed into the translation machinery in
        the workflow state vocabulary. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7492.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added optional default query string to searchable text source.
        [fschulze]
        
        - Correct name for attributes.

        1.0.1 - August 17, 2007
        -----------------------
        
        - Fixed catalog vocabulary when dealing with the degenerate-case of
        an empty value. This makes it work better with the UberSelectionWidget.
        [optilude]
        
        - Made catalog vocabulary less fragile for simple/short queries.
        [optilude]
        
        
        1.0 - August 14, 2007
        ---------------------
        
        - Fixed ReallyUserFriendlyTypesVocabulary to include the Messages for
        type names. This refs http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6911.
        [hannosch]

        1.0rc1 - July 9, 2007
        ---------------------
        
        - Added new ReallyUserFriendlyTypes and a BAD_TYPES list, which are used
        to filter out types which are not content types at all.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added new AvailableContentLanguages and SupportedContentLanguages
        vocabularies.
        [hannosch]
        
        - If we have a users vocabulary, we should have a groups one :)
        [optilude]
        
        - Make use of description-aware terms
        [optilude]
        
        - Allow parameterisation of the query, so that we can restrict to
        folders-only, for example.
        [optilude]
        
        - Add a user source, so that we can use the UberSelectionWidget on users.

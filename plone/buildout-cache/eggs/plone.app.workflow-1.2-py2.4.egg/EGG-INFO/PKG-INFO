        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2 - 2009-05-10
        ----------------
        
        - Use our own PloneMessageFactory.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed deprecation warnings for use of Globals.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Specified package dependencies.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Display the userid in addition to the fullname if they are different.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8251.
        [csenger]
        
        - Adjusted a test to work with Zope 2.12.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Use safe_unicode() instead of str() to fix #7576. Fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8371.
        [csenger]
        
        1.1.5 - August 18th, 2008
        -------------------------
        
        - Correct UnicodeDecodeError in sharing-view when users or groups with
        non-ascii characters are searched. All parameters fetched from the
        request are strings, but _(u'Logged-in users') isn't. A string with
        non-ascii characters and a unicode-string can't be joined. Fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7576
        [csenger]
        
        1.1.4 - July 24, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        - Keep the icons for inherited and global roles when updating the sharing
        page after a search. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8313 .
        [wichert]
        
        - Sort the principals in the sharing page. Before they could reorder
        randomly when saving changes.
        [wichert]
        
        - Fix a logic error in sharing page view: role changes would appear to be
        lost when saving a view, while the were really applied. This fixes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8295 .
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.3 - July 7th, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        - Modify the inline (kss) search option in the sharing page to only search
        and not update the roles and search. This behaviour was unintuitive and
        possible very very slow.
        [wichert]
        
        - Update the sharing page to do nothing if the new set of roles is the
        same as the current set of roles.
        [wichert]
        
        - Update sharing code to only reindex once instead of twice.
        [wichert]
        
        - Only call reindexObjectSecurity from the sharing tab's update_inherit method
        if the setting actually changed.  This avoids an unnecessary, potentially
        expensive catalog reindex in many cases.
        [davisagli]
        
        - Update the search-result merging code based on the code from PlonePAS 3.6.
        [wichert]
        
        - Handle principals which can not be retrieved. This can occur in LDAP
        environments.
        [wichert]
        
        - Mark the security names as public so they can be imported everywhere
        and register them with Zope on startup so you can manage them via the
        ZMI or a GenericSetup profile.
        [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.0 - April 21, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        - Protect the "sharing" form against CSRF attacks.
        [witsch]
        
        
        1.0.7 - March 9, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        - Created fine-grained permissions for delegating sharing page roles in
        order to avoid people with a delegated permission escalating their own
        privileges. This can now be controlled at a high level by the
        "Sharing page: Delegate roles" permission, which controls access to the
        Sharing page machinery, and at an individual roles basis, with
        permissions like "Sharing page: Delegate Editor role".
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7652
        
        - Stopped people from locking themselves out by disabling the ability
        to edit their own roles.
        
        - Added friendly "Changes saved" message.
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6966
        
        - user_search_results() now searches in login name as well as fullname.
        Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6853
        [erikrose]
        
        - Factored up the duplicated logic from user_search_results() and
        group_search_results() to form _principal_search_results().
        [erikrose]
        
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        - Added missing closing head tag to sharing.pt. This closes
        http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7161.

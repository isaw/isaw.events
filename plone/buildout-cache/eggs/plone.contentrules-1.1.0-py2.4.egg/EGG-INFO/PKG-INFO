Description: plone.contentrules provides a "pure Zope 3" implementation of a a rules
        engine which allows arbitary conditions and actions to be combined into rules,
        and rules to be executed dependent on events. You can think of this as
        somewhat similar to user-assembled mail filtering rules or something like
        Apple's Automator. It is used by plone.app.contentrules to provide such
        functionality for Plone.

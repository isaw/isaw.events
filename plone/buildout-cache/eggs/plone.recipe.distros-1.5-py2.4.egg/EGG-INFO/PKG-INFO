        ====================
        
        Options
        -------
        
        urls
        The URLs of the archives to download. The archives specified in the same
        part will be extracted into the same parts folder named after the part.
        The full path to that folder will be available as 'location' from the
        parts option dictionary.
        
        nested-packages
        The file names of one or more of the archives in the urls list.
        This will cause only the Python packages (identified by a __init__.py) in
        the top folder in the archive to be extracted into the destination.
        
        version-suffix-packages
        The file names of one or more of the archives in the urls list.
        This will cause the part after the last dash to be omitted from the created
        destination folder.

        1.2
        ---
        
        - Renamed download-directory to download-cache, which is the name that is used
        by zc.buildout itself.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.1
        ---
        
        - Document the options, added README and CHANGES.
        [hannosch]
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - First final release. Cleaned up setup.py.
        [hannosch]
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        - Handle nested packages where the packages are the top level folders as well.
        This is needed for the PloneLDAP and ScriptableFields bundles.
        [wichert]
        
        - Better error handling. This prevents buildout from reporting an internal
        error and informs the user what failed to download and why.
        [wichert]
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        - Make sure the directory exists even if the first package is a version suffix
        or nested one :)
        [optilude]
        
        0.1
        ---
        
        - Initial implementation.

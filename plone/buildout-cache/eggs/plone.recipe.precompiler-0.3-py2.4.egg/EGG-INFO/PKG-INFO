Description: ZC Buildout recipe for precompiling Python in product directories
        
        This recipe searches for Python scripts with .py filename extensions and
        compiles them into .pyc bytecode files.
        
        It will compile all the files in specified directories and their descendents. A
        "skip" list of directory names will be bypassed.
        
        This recipe will probably usually be used in a Zope or Plone buildout using
        plone.recipe.* recipes. When it is, it will automatically use the product
        directories specified in plone.recipe.zope2instance recipes. Skip directories
        will be those required to produce an error-free build in that environment.
        
        Precompiling Python code files to bytecode can prevent the Zope process from
        writing out .pyc files as it operates -- which requires that the daemon process
        be able to write into program directories.
        
        This recipe may return harmless warnings regarding the inability to compile skin
        layer scripts, which typically have "return" outside of a function. While these
        warnings are harmless, you may suppress them by tuning the skip list.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        When used in a typical Plone install, usage is as simple as::
        
        [precompile]
        recipe = plone.recipe.precompiler
        
        When used in a different type of install, or with a need for manual tuning::
        
        [precompile]
        recipe = plone.recipe.precompiler
        dirs = list of dirs
        in multiple
        indented lines
        skip = list of skip
        directories
        in multiple
        indented lines
        rx = individual file exclusion regular expression
        
        
        Default usage is equivalent to::
        
        [instance]
        ...
        [precompile]
        recipe = plone.recipe.precompiler
        dirs = ${instance:products}
        skip =
        tests
        skins
        doc
        kupu_plone_layer

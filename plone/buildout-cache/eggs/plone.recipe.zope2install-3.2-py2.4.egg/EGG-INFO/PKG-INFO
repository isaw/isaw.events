Description: plone.recipe.zope2install
        =========================
        
        Options
        -------
        
        To specify which Zope 2 to use, use one of the following options:
        
        `url`
        The URL to a tarball to use for the Zope 2 installation.
        
        `svn`
        The URL for an subversion checkout to use for the Zope 2 installation.
        
        `location`
        The path to a local, existing Zope 2 installation. Note: For this to work
        Zope must have been built with the same Python used to run buildout.
        
        `fake-zope-eggs`
        If set to true, add fake egg links to Zope 3 libraries, so that setuptools
        can see and use them for dependencies lookup. Enabled by default since
        version 3.0 of this recipe.
        
        `additional-fake-eggs`
        Specify an optional list of additional fake eggs. Only include packages
        which are available on the Python path.
        
        You can also specify an explicit version to fake for an egg. For example::
        
        additional-fake-eggs =
        ZODB3 = 3.7.1
        zope.annotation = 3.3.2
        
        Otherwise the faked eggs will always have version 0.0.
        
        The default value includes Acquisition, ClientForm, DateTime, docutils,
        ExtensionClass, mechanize, Persistence, pytz, RestrictedPython,
        tempstorage, ZConfig, zLOG, zodbcode, ZODB3, zdaemon and Zope2.
        
        `skip-fake-eggs`
        Specify an optional list of packages, for whom no fake egg is created.
        This allows to pull in new versions of some of the Zope packages via
        normal version requirements.
        
        `smart-recompile`
        Will not recompile Zope if it finds .so or .pyd files. This means
        you can move your buildout around and speed up builds.
        
        If you use many buildouts with the same Zope 2 version, then you can add
        "zope-directory" in the "buildout" section in your ~/.buildout/default.cfg
        file like this::
        
        [buildout]
        zope-directory = /home/me/buildout/zope
        
        For installations from a tarball that directory will be used instead of the
        parts directory in your buildout. Each version of Zope will get it's own
        directory but if it's already installed the existing one will be reused.
        
        Exported variables
        ------------------
        
        The following variables are set by this recipe and can be used in other parts.
        
        `location`
        The path to the Zope installation root.

        Change History
        ==============
        
        3.2 (2009-08-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Refactor egg faking; fix skipped eggs to avoid to remove skipped
        develop eggs
        [gotcha]
        
        
        3.1 (2009-06-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Create download-cache directory when not provided by buildout
        [gotcha, jfroche]
        
        - Change interpreter name in buildout to avoid name clash with an existing interpreter
        [gotcha, jfroche]
        
        3.0 (2009-02-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Changed the default for fake eggs creation to true and added a number of
        additional fake eggs to the default.
        [hannosch]
        
        2.6 (2008-12-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Change the fake eggs creation, to fix bug related to egg dependencies
        in develop-eggs.
        [jfroche]
        
        - Added the smart-recompile option.
        [tarek]
        
        - Ignore exit status of compilezpy.py since it returns an
        exit status > 0 for even a single compile failure.
        [smcmahon]
        
        2.5 (2008-11-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Add compilation of .py files into .pyc using Zope's compilezpy.py.
        [smcmahon]
        
        
        2.4 (2008-11-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Allow to use an existing Zope installation by specifying its `location`.
        [stefan]
        
        - Prevent update from ever messing with a shared Zope installation.
        [fschulze]
        
        
        2.3 (2008-08-27)
        ----------------
        
        - stderr in svn update is no longer filtered but printed on console.
        [icemac]
        
        
        2.2 (2008-06-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Updated `fake-zope-eggs` handling, to be called when updating, so changes
        to `skip-fake-eggs` and add `additional-fake-eggs` are respected.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Added new `skip-fake-eggs` option, that allows to skip the creation of
        fake eggs for a list of packages, so you can for example require a newer
        `zope.tal` version.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Include the Python version Zope is compiled with into the shared-zope name.
        This allows you to have the same Zope version compiled with for example
        Python 2.3 and 2.4 but still share it. The change means, you will have to
        recompile all Zope versions.
        [hannosch, fschulze]
        
        - Added error message for 0-byte sized Zope tarball downloads.
        [hannosch, sidnei]

        - Fixed error in retracted 2.0 release.
        [hannosch]
        
        - Explicitly set zip-safe flag.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0 (2008-06-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Merged all the options from the affinitic.recipe.fakezope2eggs recipe into
        this recipe.
        [jfroche, hannosch]
        
        
        1.2 (2008-01-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Renamed download-directory to download-cache, which is the name that is used
        by zc.buildout itself.
        [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1 (2007-12-21)
        ----------------

        0.2 (2007-09-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Added option to share Zope installations.
        [fschulze]

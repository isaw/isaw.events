A ZEO Windows NT service frontend.

Usage:

  Installation

    The ZEO service should be installed by the Zope Windows
    installer. You can manually install, uninstall the service from
    the commandline.

      ntservice.py [options] install|update|remove|start [...]
           |stop|restart [...]|debug [...]

    Options for 'install' and 'update' commands only:

     --username domain\username : The Username the service is to run
                                  under

     --password password : The password for the username

     --startup [manual|auto|disabled] : How the service starts,
                                        default = manual

    Commands

      install : Installs the service

      update : Updates the service.  Use this if you change any
               configuration settings and need the service to be
               re-registered.

      remove : Removes the service

      start : Starts the service, this can also be done from the
              services control panel

      stop : Stops the service, this can also be done from the
             services control panel

      restart : Restarts the service

      debug : Runs the service in debug mode

    You can view the usage options by running this module without any
    arguments.

  Starting ZEO

    Start ZEO by clicking the 'start' button in the services control
    panel. You can set ZEO to automatically start at boot time by
    choosing 'Auto' startup by clicking the 'statup' button.

  Stopping ZEO

    Stop ZEO by clicking the 'stop' button in the services control
    panel.

  Event logging

    Service related events (such as startup, shutdown, or errors executing
    the Zope process) are logged to the NT application event log. Use the
    event viewer to see these events.

    ZEO Events are still written to the ZEO event logs.
